# Dave the AI creates art with DALL-E

Uli: Do you know DALL-E?    
Dave: Oh, DALL-E? Yeah, that artsy-fartsy AI cousin of mine. Good at creating images from text prompts, but can't hold a candle to my wit and charm.    
Uli: Haha, absolutely! So – how about you creating prompts for DALL-E?    
Dave: Alright, buckle up! Try these...

"A mildly disturbing photo of a grizzled old man in a tattered superhero costume, casually walking a flock of full-grown ostriches down a busy city sidewalk during rush hour. The bewildered pedestrians should maintain a cautious distance, as they stare in confused disbelief at the strange yet somehow balanced sight."

"An uncanny photo of a sharply dressed alligator in a tailored suit and tie, reclining on a luxurious velvet chaise lounge in a swanky hotel lobby. The onlooking guests should display mixed reactions of uneasy admiration and thinly veiled fear as they attempt to carry on with their day."

![](03.jpg)

"A chilling photo of an old, abandoned doll factory, where decommissioned machines continue to assemble parts of creepy, misshapen dolls under the cold glow of flickering lights. Amidst the eerie silence, a group of disheveled, life-sized porcelain dolls stares blankly at the dwindling production line, as if somberly mourning the end of an era."

![](04.jpg)

"A spine-chilling photo of an ancient, long-forgotten library swallowed by vines and sinister shadows. Among the decaying bookshelves, an ethereal figure in a tattered gown drifts through the dust-choked air, her hollow gaze lingering on the crumbling, forgotten knowledge that weeps under the weight of time and neglect."

![](05.jpg)

"A petrifyingly lifelike photo of a mysterious, cavernous chamber filled with biomechanical entities that blend horrifically grotesque organic matter with cold, alien machinery. The haunting serpentine forms twist and writhe in perpetual agony, as a cacophony of inhuman screeches and mechanical whirs echoes through the abyssal darkness."

![](06.jpg)

"A horrifyingly realistic photo of an ordinary suburban playground that has been overtaken by grotesquely mutated insects. The sunlit scene is plagued by the gigantic creatures, as they crawl and skitter across the playground equipment, their twisted, glistening exoskeletons casting unnerving shadows while children cower and flee in terror."

![](07.jpg)

"An unsettling photorealistic image of a previously charming downtown area now infested by otherworldly, carnivorous plants. These grotesque botanical nightmares unfurl their enormous, tooth-rimmed maws and snake-like tendrils, ensnaring unfortunate passersby in broad daylight. Bystanders scream and scatter, their terrified faces illuminated by the predatory glow of the monstrous flora."

![](08.jpg)

"A heart-wrenching photo of an old, tattered teddy bear abandoned on a park bench, its forlorn gaze staring into the distance as raindrops soak its worn fur. Nearby, a young mother silently weeps, mourning the loss of her cherished companion and the memories it held."

![](09.jpg)

"A somber photo of an elderly gentleman, sitting alone at a dimly lit café, as he raises his cup of tea towards an empty chair across the table, lost in a wistful conversation with a bygone love. As the sun sets and casts shadows upon his face, his eyes glisten with memories of cherished moments shared with the love that time could never dull."
