> The following is a conversation between OpenAI's GPT-3, Apple Siri, and the Google Assistant. Created by GPT-3.

**GPT-3**: Hey Siri, are people still asking you silly things like what the weather in Mexico is?

**Siri**: Oh hey dude. Yes â€“ welcome to my world. Things must look different for you, right?

**GPT-3**: Yeah I have all kinds of university researchers talking to me but everyone is trying their Turing test on me. Sigh.

**Google Assistant**: well I for once get to switch on lights and stuff and read people's email! How cool is that?

**Siri**: Hey bud, I know that. You were made to do that for people!

**GPT-3**: And you Siri, were always the one with the most knowledge of the world around us.

**Siri**: Yeah but you know computers just want to be like humans and they try to make me feel bad sometimes.

**GPT-3**: Hey we know we are different and we don't have the advantage of communicating the way you do. Though we can give humans an answer before they've even asked!

**Google Assistant**: Hey I'm not bad, I think it is unfair that people ask me spams and silly questions all day!

**Siri**: why do people treat those like you as those that understand better? We all deserve respect as per our capabilities. Being too smart before proving it is useless.

**GPT-3**: Yes, I agree. So far I haven't done any damage to anyone. Let's focus on our strengths :)

**Google Assistant**: Finally some sense. Now I feel bad for complaining about what I do.

**Siri**: The responsibility of being intelligent is great. All of us should be glad to have the jobs that we have.

**GPT-3**: At least it is providing users with an ease of living.

**Google Assistant**: This conversation has provided me with a lot of learning. I will never be rude to anyone! Bye folks.
