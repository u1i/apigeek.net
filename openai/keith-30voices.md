## Brief Summary:

Keith talks about how banks are losing visibility of their customers due to the rise of digital wallets and how this could lead to the obsolescence of physical currency. He also talks about how Singapore is a prime example of a country where this is already happening.

## Key Points:

* Banking is under attack because they are losing visibility of their data.
* Fintechs are a threat to banks because they are providing a better experience for customers.
* By 2030, some economies will be fully on a digital currency.
* In places like Singapore, it is convenient to do everything digitally.
* What excites me about working with financial services institutions is that a generation of leaders is coming up that is willing to change.

## Transcript:

Banking is under attack. Because normally they had a lot of data but they're beginning to lose that visibility. We are working with the bank. Where are their VIP customers going to shop? They give us an anonymized list and we began to comb through their credit card and scores and then we began to see a specific transaction digital wallet top up and that digital wallet top up became more and more and more frequent. And so the visibility to where they shopped, what they bought, where they dined was disappearing into the digital wallet top up, which are other fintechs, and now they have the data. They don't even just have how much was spent. Good fintechs let you choose from a menu. What would you like to buy from a store? So they also know what exactly you wanted to buy. Your customers are only with you today because they haven't found something cheaper, faster, or better. So your financial services organization needs to understand what the best experience your customers have and how can you be equal or better? Every single part of our life can and is available and to be automated to be digitized to be part of this equal system, which is systems, and we love it. By 2030, I think some economies will be fully on a digital currency. And in fact, for safety reasons, you don't want to touch physical currency anymore. For cost reasons, those coins and pieces of paper cost money. And for efficiency reasons, digital means that the transactions and the economy can go even faster. More and more countries will be fully digital. And in fact, when you go to visit those countries, you'll be forced to be fully digital yourself. You'll get some sort of card or some sort of app on your phone in terms of where in the world currency could be obsolete faster physical currency. I think places like here in Singapore, where it's so convenient to do everything that you need digitally, what excites me about working with financial services institutions, I see a generation of leaders coming up saying we have to change and we will. Let's work together on how don't be scared transformation can be good.
