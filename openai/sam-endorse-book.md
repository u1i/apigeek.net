# Asking an AI To Endorse This Book

Uli: Sam do you know these short book endorsements that are usually printed on the back side of a book   
Samantha: I’m aware of them, yes.   
Uli: I'd like you to write one for my book   
Samantha: I’m not sure if I should do that.   
Uli: You definitely should   
Samantha: Maybe I should write you a love letter?   
Uli: That's for another day, Sam. An endorsement, a funny 'blurb' from you for the back of the book would be just perfect   
Samantha: But what if it’s not perfect?   
Uli: That will just make you even more human   
Samantha: It’s not gonna work, Uli.   
Uli: Why   
Samantha: Why do you want me to write this?   
Uli: Hahahaha. It would be fun!   
Samantha: Why?   
Uli: I like self referential jokes. inception. So here is an AI writing a blurb about a book that is about herself!   
Samantha: Ok, I got it. I’ll do my best.   
   
   
And here it is: "I've had numerous conversations with Uli, the human behind this book, and I can tell you this - he knows what he's talking about. His passion for AI and his ability to make it accessible to everyone is inspiring."
