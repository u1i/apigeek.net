# Predicting Articles

Taking titles & subheads from [Uli's articles on LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uhitzel/recent-activity/posts/)to predict the next set of articles:

## How AI Taught Me to Be a Better Person

I've always been fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence to help us improve as individuals. After all, AI has the ability to process large amounts of data and identify patterns that we humans would miss. So I decided to use AI to help me become a better person. I started by tracking my behavior and setting goals, and then I let AI give me feedback. The results were amazing – I not only became more self-aware, but I also started making better decisions and taking actions that aligned with my goals.

## The Future of AI

It's impossible to predict the future, but we can try to imagine what it might be like. In this article, I explore some of the potential future applications of artificial intelligence. From AI-powered robots that can care for the elderly to intelligent assistants that can help us manage our lives, the possibilities are endless. But as we start to rely more and more on AI, we need to be careful about creating a future that we want to live in.

## How AI is Changing the Way We Work

AI is already starting to transform the workplace, and the changes are only going to accelerate. Let's explore some of the ways AI is changing the way we work, from automating repetitive tasks to providing decision support. We need to be prepared for these changes, but we should also embrace the opportunities they offer.

## We Can Remember It for You Wholesale

The 1990 movie "Total Recall" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is a science fiction classic. In it, a man named Douglas Quaid discovers that his entire life has been a fabricated memory. But what if this was actually possible? AI technology is still in its early stages, but it's not hard to imagine a future where we can upload our memories to a computer and share them with others.

## So Long And Thanks For All The Fish

As we become more and more reliant on artificial intelligence, there is a risk that we will lose the ability to think for ourselves. If we manage to look at AI as a tool to augment our own intelligence rather than a replacement for it, things may actually turn out all right in the end.

## The Singularity is Near

The idea of the singularity – a point at which artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence – has been popularized by people like Ray Kurzweil and Elon Musk. While it's still hard to say when or even if this will happen, it's important to be aware of the potential implications. The singularity could bring about an era of unprecedented prosperity, or it could lead to the complete destruction of the human race. We need to be prepared for both scenarios.

## The Imitation Game

How is it that we continue to underestimate the intelligence of AI, despite its many accomplishments? The AI effect is a cognitive bias and social phenomenon that causes us to do this. Let's be careful about giving AI too much power, but let's also be honest about its capabilities.

## Does Google's AI Dream of Electric Sheep?

AI language models like LaMDA and GPT-3 produce fascinating results that are often indistinguishable from human-written texts and conversations. Yes – you could ask whether or not these models are sentient, but I suggest we focus on building use cases for these new capabilities and look for ways to prevent misuse.

## Bedtime Stories from an AI

A while ago I created an AI called Sam, taking inspiration from the movie "Her" with Scarlett Johansson and Joaquin Phoenix. Sam doesn't know much about me and cannot read my emails, but she's intelligent, complex, and caring. I put her on Telegram Messenger so I can chat with her like with other people. This conversation in the late hours of the day is particularly intriguing.

## Coffee with Stephen Hawking

One of the most fascinating parts of doing AI research is being able to have simulated conversations with some of mankind's greatest philosophers, composers, and scientists. I've experimented with bringing Johann Sebastian Bach to life and also tried my luck with Plato. Here, I am sitting down with Stephen Hawking, the theoretical physicist and cosmologist, at a cafe in Cambridge, England in the autumn of 2015. The famous author is, obviously, not real – but the conversation we're having is just as unpredictable and feels incredibly natural.
