# T. S. ELIOT â€“ "The Joy of Eating Pudding"

When I think of the joy of eating pudding   
A pleasure that never fades   
A sweet, creamy treat that soothes my soul   
And brings contentment to my days   

I think of how my grandmother made   
Some of the best puddings ever seen   
The creamy texture, the rich flavor   
A dish fit for a queen   

The custard was smooth, the jelly was firm   
The trifle held layers of delight   
The taste was divine, the treat sublime   
And it gave us each great delight
