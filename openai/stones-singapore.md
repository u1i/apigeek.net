# Rolling Stones â€“ Singapore

We came to Singapore   
In the heat of the night   
We were looking for something   
To make us feel all right   

We found a little club   
And we started to groove   
The music was playing   
And we started to move   

We were shaking our hips   
And we were shaking our feet   
The whole place was shaking   
From the rhythm of the beat   

We were dancing all night   
Until the break of dawn   
We were dancing like there's   
No tomorrow   

Singapore, Singapore   
You're the one that we need   
Singapore, Singapore   
You're the one that we need   

We were looking for something   
To make us feel all right   
And we found it in Singapore   
In the heat of the night
