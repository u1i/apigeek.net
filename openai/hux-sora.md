# Sora and Sibor

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:36:50 AM]:
Hello, Joe! What would you like to discuss?

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:36:56 AM]:
can you tell me what SIBOR is

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:37:00 AM]:
Sure, SIBOR is an acronym for the Singapore Interbank Offered rate which is the interest rate at which banks offer to lend "unsecured" funds to other banks in Singapore.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:37:31 AM]:
I have a housing loan that somehow has SIBOR in it. I don't exactly understand what that means

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:37:33 AM]:
Yes, SIBOR is used as a reference rate to calculate the interest rates on different types of financial products such as mortgage loans.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:37:45 AM]:
is that good for me?

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:37:46 AM]:
Yes, your mortgage loan rate is based on SIBOR.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:38:00 AM]:
what is my benefit? Why not have fixed interest rates?

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:38:03 AM]:
Fixed interest rates are typically for short-term instruments whereas SIBOR is for long-term instruments. In addition, the Singapore dollar has a history of being highly stable in value and inflation has been low (in the past).

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:38:33 AM]:
so my bank just called, saying SIBOR is going away. And the new ones are based on SORA. What is that

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:38:35 AM]:
SORA is an acronym for SIBOR's replacement. It stands for Singapore Overnight Risk-Free Rate.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:38:48 AM]:
is that better? Why the change

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:38:51 AM]:
Yes, it is. SORA is a more accurate reflection of the true cost of funds for banks.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:39:03 AM]:
what is the difference between those two? SORA and SIBOR

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:39:06 AM]:
The SORA rate is the risk-free interest rate at which banks are willing to lend funds, whereas the SIBOR is based on the rates at which banks actually do lend.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:39:33 AM]:
what does it mean for me as a consumer? And you probably know I am not a finance person at all

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:39:36 AM]:
The SORA is a more accurate reflection of the true cost of funds for banks. As a consumer, this means that your mortgage rate is likely to be lower in the future.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:41:38 AM]:
it feels really complex to me

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:41:40 AM]:
Yes, that's because the financial industry is complex. It takes a lot of training and experience to understand it.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:42:02 AM]:
yeah well I just want to know what is better for me

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:42:03 AM]:
The SORA is better for you. It means that your mortgage rate should be lower in the future.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:43:10 AM]:
they offer 1 month Compounded SORA Packages and one for 3 months

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:43:11 AM]:
Yes, you can choose from different SORA Packages.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:43:19 AM]:
why? and what is the difference

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:43:21 AM]:
The interest rates in the SORA Packages are re-set every day and you can choose from a range of different packages.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:43:44 AM]:
what does it mean 1 month compound package? 3 months?

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:43:47 AM]:
The 1 month Compounded SORA Package has the lowest interest rate, which means that you will pay less in interest. The 3 month package compound is calculated daily, meaning that you pay interest on the principle and all of the previous days' interest for three months.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:45:32 AM]:
why would anyone choose the 3 months package?

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:45:35 AM]:
Some people prefer the 3 months package because they are aware that they'll need to pay a lump sum at the end of the three months and want to spread out their payments as much as possible.

Joe Chip, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:46:53 AM]:
thanks Huxley! this helped

Huxley, [24 Jun 2022 at 11:46:55 AM]:
You're welcome. I'm always happy to help!
