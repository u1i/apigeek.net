# The last job on Earth: imagining a fully automated world (The Guardian, Short Movie)

(The film opens with gentle, atmospheric electronic music that sets a calm yet slightly melancholic tone. This music continues and evolves throughout the story.)

## Visual Style and Setting:

The film is an animation with a distinct, minimalist style. It uses a limited color palette, dominated by purples, teals, yellows, and muted greys. Shapes are clean and often geometric. The world depicted is a highly advanced, futuristic city, characterized by immense, sterile skyscrapers and autonomous technology. There is a stark contrast between the pristine, automated world of the wealthy and the decaying, forgotten world of the displaced working class. Light and shadow are used dramatically to emphasize scale and emotion, often showing the main character as a small figure in a vast, impersonal environment.

## Scene-by-Scene Description:

The film begins with the logo of The Guardian.

The first scene is inside a dark, minimalist bedroom, bathed in a deep purple hue. A woman with short, black hair is asleep in a modern, low-profile bed. Underneath the bed, a stylized, robotic-looking cat with glowing eyes is also asleep. A thin, bright line of white light, like a scanner, sweeps across the floor. It passes over the cat, which wakes up, stretches, and then leaps onto the bed, nudging the woman awake.

As the woman sits up, the camera pulls back, revealing her bedroom is a single, pod-like apartment unit. We see it from the outside, one of hundreds set into the face of a colossal skyscraper. An automated, drone-like device is cleaning the exterior of her window. The view is of a futuristic city at dawn, with sleek, flying vehicles zipping between towering buildings under a hazy, purple sky. The title appears in clean, white letters: "The Last Job on Earth."

The scene shifts to the woman's bathroom. She's standing in front of her mirror, brushing her teeth with an electric toothbrush. The mirror is not a simple mirror but a smart interface. First, it displays a breaking news ticker: "JOB RUMOURS IN INDIA SPARK MIGRATION CRISIS." Then, it shows an advertisement for a "CATBOT 2.0 UPDATE." The toothbrush itself seems to scan her mouth, and the mirror's display changes to a "DAILY HEALTH REPORT." A plus symbol appears, followed by the text: "POTENTIAL MALADY DETECTED," and then it automatically confirms a medical appointment for her. Her face is passive, almost weary, throughout this automated morning routine.

She walks out of the bathroom. Her robot cat rolls up to her feet. A wall panel slides open silently, revealing a pre-selected outfit hanging in the air: a yellow cropped jacket, a white t-shirt, and green trousers. Everything is chosen for her.

We cut to an external shot of a different, impossibly tall skyscraper. A digital sign on its roof flips from "FOR SALE: 1000 APARTMENTS" to "STILL VACANT," suggesting a hollowed-out economy despite the advanced technology.

The woman, now dressed and carrying a white backpack, walks through a vast, airy, and beautiful public space. It looks like a high-end shopping mall or transit station, with curving green architecture and lush hanging plants. The floors are highly polished and reflective. As she walks, a personalized holographic advertisement appears in front of her, addressing her by name: "ALICE, YOUR DREAM DRESS AWAITS IN STORE." A stylized, computer-generated woman models the dress, then glides away on a self-balancing platform, effortlessly carrying shopping bags. Alice glances at it, her expression unchanged, and continues on her way.

She arrives at an entrance marked "WELCOME, MEDICAL CENTRE." Inside, there are no doctors or nurses. She steps onto a platform, and a large, green, automated machine scans her entire body with a rotating ring of light. A screen on the machine flashes: "CHEST INFECTION DETECTED," followed by "DISPENSING MEDICATION." A small box containing her medicine is dispensed from a slot. The camera pulls far back, showing Alice as a tiny, solitary figure next to the enormous, impersonal medical machine.

Next, Alice is seated in a sleek, autonomous travel pod, which glides on an elevated track through the city. She looks at a transparent, tablet-like device. The pod travels from the pristine, bright part of the city into a darker, grittier area. Here, the buildings are old, brick-and-mortar structures, looking decayed and neglected. A large, ominous sign reads "OVER 30s RETIREMENT HOME." The music becomes more somber.

Through the window of her pod, Alice sees the people left behind by automation. They are wearing virtual reality headsets, simulating old jobs. One poster advertises "NEW SIM! VR BRICK LAYING." Another shows a "VR MARKETING CONSULTANT." Alice watches as the pod passes a long queue of weary-looking people outside a "FOOD BANK." Graffiti on the walls reads "WE NEED WORK!" and "STOP AUTO!" This is the other side of her convenient, automated life.

Her pod arrives at its destination: a massive, severe-looking corporate building with the name "CORP TECH INC." She gets out and walks towards the entrance. The scale of the corporate campus is immense and empty, making her look very small and alone.

The final sequence takes place inside the building. Alice sits at a single, illuminated desk in the middle of a vast, dark, and cavernous office space. Her laptop screen glows, displaying the words: "GOOD MORNING ALICE." She manages a faint, tired smile. But then, the text on the screen changes. It types out: "WE'RE UPGRADING OUR WORKFORCE AND I'M SORRY TO SAY..." A small padlock icon appears. Her access is terminated. Her job, the last job on Earth for her, has been automated away. Her face falls, her expression a mixture of shock and resignation.

The camera pulls back, and back, and back, until Alice is just a tiny speck of light at her desk, engulfed by the darkness of the empty office, which is in turn surrounded by the towering, indifferent silhouettes of the city skyscrapers. The shot emphasizes her profound loneliness and obsolescence in a world that no longer needs her.

The film ends with two quotes on a black screen:
"Machines could take 50% of jobs in the next 30 years" - Moshe Vardi, Professor of computer science, Rice University.
"Machines are already undertaking tasks which were unthinkable - if not unimaginable - a decade ago" - Andy Haldane, Chief economist, Bank of England.

The final frames show the credits and the Guardian logo as the melancholic music fades out.
