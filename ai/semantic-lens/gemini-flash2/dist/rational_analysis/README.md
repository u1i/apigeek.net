### Logic

The study of valid reasoning and argumentation, providing rules for drawing correct inferences and identifying fallacies. It is fundamental for building consistent and reliable knowledge systems.

### Mathematics

A formal system of abstract structures and relationships, used to model and quantify phenomena. It provides a precise language for expressing knowledge and deriving new insights through calculation and proof.

### Critical Thinking

The ability to analyze information objectively, evaluate evidence, and form reasoned judgments. It is essential for assessing the validity and reliability of knowledge claims and identifying biases.

### Deduction

Reasoning from general principles to specific conclusions. It allows us to derive new knowledge from existing knowledge by applying logical rules.

### Inference

The process of drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. It allows us to extend our knowledge beyond direct observation and make predictions about the world.
