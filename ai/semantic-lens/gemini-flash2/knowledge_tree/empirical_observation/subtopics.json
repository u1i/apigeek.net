    {
      "name": "Sensory Perception",
      "description": "The foundation of empirical observation, involving the use of our senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell) to gather information about the external world. It's the initial interface between the observer and reality, providing the raw data that fuels further analysis and understanding, aligning with the framework's emphasis on direct experience."
    },
    {
      "name": "Experimentation",
      "description": "A systematic approach to manipulating variables and observing the resulting effects, allowing for controlled testing of hypotheses and the establishment of causal relationships. Experimentation builds upon sensory perception by actively probing the world and generating data to validate or refute theories, reflecting the framework's focus on testing models of reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Measurement and Quantification",
      "description": "The process of assigning numerical values to observed phenomena, enabling precise and objective analysis. Measurement transforms qualitative observations into quantitative data, facilitating mathematical modeling and statistical analysis, which are crucial for rational analysis within the broader framework."
    },
    {
      "name": "Data Collection and Analysis",
      "description": "The systematic gathering and organization of empirical data, followed by the application of statistical and computational techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. This component bridges the gap between raw observation and meaningful insights, allowing us to construct evidence-based models of the world, consistent with the framework's emphasis on both empirical data and rational analysis."
    },
    {
      "name": "Observation Bias Mitigation",
      "description": "Techniques and strategies employed to minimize the influence of subjective biases and preconceptions on empirical observations. This includes rigorous experimental design, blinding, and the use of standardized protocols to ensure objectivity and reliability, aligning with the framework's commitment to building knowledge on a foundation of verifiable evidence."
