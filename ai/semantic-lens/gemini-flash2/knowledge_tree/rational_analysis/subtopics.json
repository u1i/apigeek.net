    {
      "name": "Logic",
      "description": "The study of valid reasoning and argumentation. It provides the formal systems and rules for deriving conclusions from premises, ensuring the consistency and coherence of our knowledge. Logic is crucial for analyzing empirical data and constructing sound theories, aligning with the framework's emphasis on rational analysis."
    },
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "description": "The abstract study of numbers, quantities, and shapes. It provides a precise language and set of tools for modeling and analyzing the world, enabling us to make quantitative predictions and understand complex systems. Mathematics is essential for both empirical observation (data analysis) and rational analysis (theoretical modeling)."
    },
    {
      "name": "Critical Thinking",
      "description": "The ability to analyze information objectively and make reasoned judgments. It involves evaluating evidence, identifying biases, and considering alternative perspectives. Critical thinking is vital for assessing the validity of empirical claims, the soundness of logical arguments, and the ethical implications of knowledge, thus connecting rational analysis to all other framework categories."
    },
    {
      "name": "Deductive Reasoning",
      "description": "A method of reasoning in which conclusions are drawn from premises with certainty. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is a core component of rational analysis, allowing us to derive new knowledge from existing knowledge through logical inference and build internally consistent systems of thought."
    },
    {
      "name": "Inductive Reasoning",
      "description": "A method of reasoning in which conclusions are drawn from premises with probability. It involves generalizing from specific observations to broader principles. While not guaranteeing certainty, inductive reasoning is crucial for forming hypotheses based on empirical data and developing theories that explain the world, bridging the gap between observation and rational understanding."
