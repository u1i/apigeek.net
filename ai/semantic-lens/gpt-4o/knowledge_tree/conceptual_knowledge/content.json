    "framework_context": "Conceptual Knowledge is the second domain in the overarching framework of human knowledge. It serves as the intermediary between Perceptual Knowledge, which provides raw sensory data, and higher-order domains like Relational, Practical, and Reflective Knowledge. Conceptual Knowledge organizes and interprets perceptual inputs into abstract concepts, categories, and frameworks, enabling structured understanding. It exemplifies the transformative process where raw experience is synthesized into meaning, forming the basis for further intellectual exploration and application.",
