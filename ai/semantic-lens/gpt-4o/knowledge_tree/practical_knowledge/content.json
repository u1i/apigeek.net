    "framework_context": "Practical Knowledge represents the application-oriented domain of our philosophical framework. It is the bridge between abstract understanding (Conceptual Knowledge) and real-world action, embodying the translation of theoretical insights into tangible outcomes. Rooted in Perceptual Knowledge through direct interaction with the environment and informed by Relational Knowledge through its contextual and systemic considerations, Practical Knowledge is refined and evaluated through Reflective Knowledge. It exemplifies the dynamic and iterative nature of human understanding, where knowledge is not only acquired but also utilized and tested in practice.",
