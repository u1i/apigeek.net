    "framework_context": "Perceptual Knowledge is the foundational domain within the philosophical framework of human knowledge. It represents the direct interface between the external world and human cognition, serving as the raw input from which all other forms of knowledge are derived. Within the Level 0 worldview, it exemplifies the principle that all understanding originates from sensory experience, forming the bedrock upon which conceptual, relational, practical, and reflective knowledge are built. It is the starting point of the knowledge hierarchy, grounding abstract and theoretical constructs in observable reality.",

        "name": "Empirical Evidence",
        "explanation": "Knowledge that is validated through direct observation and sensory experience, forming the cornerstone of scientific inquiry."

        "name": "Objectivity of Observation",
        "description": "Perceptual knowledge strives to capture the external world as it is, independent of subjective biases, though it is always filtered through human sensory and cognitive systems."

    "implications": "Perceptual Knowledge underscores the interconnectedness of all domains of understanding by anchoring them in observable reality. It ensures that abstract and theoretical knowledge remains grounded, fostering a coherent and unified framework of human understanding. By emphasizing the primacy of sensory experience, it highlights the importance of empirical validation and the continuous interplay between observation and interpretation in the pursuit of truth."
