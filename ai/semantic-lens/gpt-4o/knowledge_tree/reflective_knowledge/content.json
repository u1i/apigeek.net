    "framework_context": "Reflective Knowledge represents the meta-cognitive layer of the knowledge framework. It is the domain where humans analyze, question, and refine their understanding. Positioned as the culmination of the knowledge process, it integrates insights from Perceptual, Conceptual, Relational, and Practical Knowledge to evaluate and improve the coherence, validity, and depth of understanding. Reflective Knowledge exemplifies the self-aware nature of human cognition, enabling the pursuit of truth and the evolution of knowledge systems.",
