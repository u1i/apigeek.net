# Semantic Lens - LLM Knowledge Explorer

Semantic Lens is a powerful tool that combines LLM-driven knowledge extraction with interactive visualization. It helps you explore and understand complex knowledge domains by:

1. Using LLMs to generate structured knowledge hierarchies
2. Creating intuitive, interactive visualizations of these knowledge structures

## Features

### Knowledge Generation
- **LLM-Powered Extraction**: Leverages advanced language models to build comprehensive knowledge structures
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Automatically organizes knowledge into meaningful hierarchies
- **Rich Content**: Generates detailed explanations and relationships between concepts
- **Extensible Framework**: Supports different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Interactive Visualization
- **Circular Layout**: Intuitive display of hierarchical relationships
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Click through different levels to explore sub-domains
- **Visual Grouping**: Clear visual distinction between different knowledge levels
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices

## Levels

Level 0: Fundamental Worldview/Framework

- The philosophical lens through which all knowledge is viewed
- Establishes the core organizing principles and categories

Level 1: Major Components

- How each philosophical category manifests
- Breaks down each framework category into its primary aspects

Level 2: Specific Domains

- The actual areas of study/knowledge that exemplify these components
- Maps abstract principles to concrete fields

Level 3: Subfields and Specializations

- The concrete disciplines and areas of focus
- Specific established fields of study

Level 4: Topics

- Specific areas within each discipline
- Core concepts and areas of investigation
