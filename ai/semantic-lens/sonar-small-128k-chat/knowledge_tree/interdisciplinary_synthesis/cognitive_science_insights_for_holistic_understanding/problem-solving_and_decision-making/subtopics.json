    {
      "name": "Cognitive Processes",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the mental processes involved in problem-solving and decision-making, such as perception, attention, memory, and reasoning. It draws from Cognitive Science to understand how the mind processes information and generates solutions. This understanding is essential for integrating theoretical knowledge with practical applications, aligning with the Practical Wisdom domain."

    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "This subtopic examines the ethical implications of problem-solving and decision-making. It integrates insights from Philosophy of Science to evaluate the scientific basis of ethical dilemmas and from Practical Wisdom to apply ethical reasoning in real-world contexts. This ensures that decisions are not only informed but also morally sound."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Integration",
      "description": "This subtopic highlights the importance of integrating knowledge from multiple domains to effectively address complex problems. It leverages Interdisciplinary Synthesis by combining insights from Epistemology (on the nature of knowledge), Ontology (on the nature of reality), and Cognitive Science (on mental processes) to form a comprehensive understanding of problem-solving and decision-making."
    },
    {
      "name": "Scientific Method Application",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on applying the scientific method to problem-solving and decision-making. It draws from Philosophy of Science to understand the foundations and methods of scientific inquiry, ensuring that solutions are evidence-based and rigorously tested. This aligns with the Practical Wisdom domain by translating theoretical knowledge into actionable steps."
    },
    {
      "name": "Holistic Problem-Solving Strategies",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes holistic approaches to problem-solving by considering multiple perspectives and factors. It integrates insights from Cognitive Science on mental processes, Epistemology on knowledge validation, and Ontology on the structure of reality to develop comprehensive strategies that address complex problems from various angles."
