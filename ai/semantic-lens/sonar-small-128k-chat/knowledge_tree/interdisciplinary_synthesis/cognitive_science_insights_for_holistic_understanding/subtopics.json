    {
      "name": "Perception and Attention",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how humans process sensory information and allocate cognitive resources. It relates to Level 1 by breaking down Cognitive Science into its primary aspects, such as perception and attention. It also integrates with Level 2 by mapping these principles to concrete fields like psychology and neuroscience, which are essential for understanding how knowledge is generated and validated."
    },
    {
      "name": "Memory and Learning",
      "description": "This subtopic examines the mechanisms of memory formation and learning processes. It aligns with Level 1 by focusing on cognitive functions that underlie knowledge acquisition. It connects with Level 2 by linking these processes to specific domains like education and cognitive psychology, which are crucial for understanding how knowledge is stored and retrieved."
    },
    {
      "name": "Problem-Solving and Decision-Making",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates the cognitive processes involved in solving problems and making decisions. It fits within Level 1 by highlighting the practical applications of cognitive science in real-world contexts. It integrates with Level 2 by mapping these processes to fields like artificial intelligence and decision theory, which are essential for practical wisdom."
    },
    {
      "name": "Language and Communication",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the cognitive mechanisms underlying language processing and communication. It aligns with Level 1 by breaking down cognitive science into its primary aspects related to human intelligence. It connects with Level 2 by linking these mechanisms to specific domains like linguistics and communication studies, which are vital for understanding how knowledge is shared and validated."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Synthesis",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the integration of cognitive science insights across multiple disciplines to form a comprehensive understanding. It fits within Level 1 by highlighting the interconnectedness of all knowledge domains. It integrates with Level 2 by mapping these integrative approaches to fields like cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence, which are essential for holistic understanding."
