    {
      "name": "Encoding and Consolidation",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how information is initially processed and stored in memory, including the neural mechanisms involved in encoding and consolidating information. It relates to Epistemology by examining how knowledge is initially acquired and validated, and to Cognitive Science by understanding the biological processes that underlie memory formation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Retrieval and Recall",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the processes by which stored information is retrieved and recalled. It connects to Ontology by examining the nature of being and how memories represent past experiences, and to Practical Wisdom by understanding how effective retrieval can inform decision-making and problem-solving."
    },
    {
      "name": "Learning Theories and Models",
      "description": "This subtopic examines various theoretical frameworks that explain how learning occurs, such as behaviorist, cognitive, and constructivist theories. It integrates with Philosophy of Science by evaluating the empirical evidence supporting these theories and their implications for understanding knowledge acquisition."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Plasticity and Development",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how the brain changes in response to experience and learning, including developmental aspects of memory and learning. It aligns with Cognitive Science by focusing on the neural mechanisms underlying these processes and with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by highlighting the interconnectedness of cognitive functions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Applications in Education and Training",
      "description": "This subtopic discusses how insights from memory and learning research are applied in educational settings to improve teaching methods and student outcomes. It relates to Practical Wisdom by emphasizing the practical application of theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts."
