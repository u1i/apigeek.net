      "description": "Memory and Learning is a specific domain within Cognitive Science, which is an interdisciplinary study of the mind and intelligence. This topic exemplifies Level 2 by mapping abstract principles of cognitive processes to concrete fields of study, thereby illustrating how knowledge is organized across different levels of abstraction."
