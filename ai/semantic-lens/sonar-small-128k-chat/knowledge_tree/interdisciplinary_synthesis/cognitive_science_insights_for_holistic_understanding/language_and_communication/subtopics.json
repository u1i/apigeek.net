      "description": "The study of meaning in language, which intersects with ontology by examining how words and symbols relate to reality. It also engages with epistemology by considering how we understand and validate meaning, and with cognitive science by analyzing how the brain processes linguistic information."

      "name": "Pragmatics",
      "description": "The study of how context influences the interpretation of language, integrating practical wisdom by focusing on real-world applications of communication. It also intersects with cognitive science by understanding how humans use language in social interactions and with philosophy of science by considering the role of context in scientific communication."
    },
    {
      "name": "Linguistic Relativity",
      "description": "The hypothesis that language influences thought, which connects to ontology by exploring the relationship between language and reality. It also engages with epistemology by questioning how our understanding of the world is shaped by our linguistic frameworks, and with cognitive science by examining how different languages affect cognitive processes."

    {
      "name": "Communication Theory",
      "description": "A multidisciplinary field that integrates insights from cognitive science to understand how messages are created, sent, received, and interpreted. It also intersects with practical wisdom by focusing on effective communication strategies and with philosophy of science by examining the role of communication in scientific inquiry."

    {
      "name": "Evolutionary Linguistics",
      "description": "The study of how language has evolved over time, which connects to ontology by exploring the historical development of linguistic structures. It also engages with epistemology by considering how our understanding of language history informs our knowledge about human culture and cognition, and with cognitive science by analyzing the evolutionary pressures that shaped linguistic abilities."
