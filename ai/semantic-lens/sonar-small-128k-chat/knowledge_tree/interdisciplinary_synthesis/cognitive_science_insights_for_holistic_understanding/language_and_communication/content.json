      "description": "Language and Communication is a specific domain that exemplifies the Cognitive Science component of our framework. It integrates insights from Epistemology by examining how we acquire and validate knowledge through language, and from Ontology by studying the nature of being and reality in linguistic structures. This domain also intersects with Philosophy of Science by understanding the scientific methods used in linguistic research and with Practical Wisdom by applying linguistic knowledge in real-world contexts."
