      "name": "Sensory Processing",
      "description": "The study of how sensory information is received, processed, and interpreted by the brain. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science as it delves into how the mind processes sensory data, which is fundamental to understanding perception. It also ties into Epistemology by examining how this processing affects our understanding of reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Attention Mechanisms",
      "description": "The exploration of how attention is allocated and managed in the brain. This subtopic is crucial in Cognitive Science as it explains how selective focus influences perception. It also intersects with Practical Wisdom by understanding how attention impacts decision-making and problem-solving in real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Correlates of Perception",
      "description": "The examination of the neural structures and pathways involved in perception. This subtopic integrates insights from Cognitive Science to understand the biological basis of perception, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of how knowledge is generated and processed. It also relates to Ontology by exploring the existence and reality of these neural mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "name": "Contextual Influence on Perception",
      "description": "The study of how context\u2014both internal (e.g., past experiences) and external (e.g., environment)\u2014influences perception. This subtopic highlights the interdisciplinary nature of perception by considering both cognitive and environmental factors, aligning with Interdisciplinary Synthesis. It also touches on Epistemology by understanding how context shapes our knowledge acquisition."
    },
    {
      "name": "Perceptual Biases and Heuristics",
      "description": "The investigation into common biases and heuristics that affect perception. This subtopic is significant in Cognitive Science as it reveals how mental shortcuts can lead to inaccuracies in perception. It also intersects with Practical Wisdom by recognizing these biases in real-world applications, thereby informing more accurate decision-making."
