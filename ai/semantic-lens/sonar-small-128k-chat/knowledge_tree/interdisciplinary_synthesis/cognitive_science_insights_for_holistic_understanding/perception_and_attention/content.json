      "description": "Perception and Attention is a specific domain within Cognitive Science, which is an interdisciplinary study of the mind and intelligence. This topic exemplifies Level 2 by mapping abstract principles of cognitive processes to concrete fields of study. It is part of the broader framework that includes Epistemology, Ontology, and Philosophy of Science, as it helps us understand how humans process and generate knowledge."

        "name": "Attentional Control",
        "explanation": "The ability to selectively concentrate on one aspect of the environment while ignoring others, crucial for focusing on relevant stimuli and filtering out irrelevant information."
