      "name": "Ontological Integration",
      "description": "This subtopic involves the process of integrating ontological concepts from various disciplines to form a cohesive understanding of reality. It relates to Level 2 by mapping abstract ontological principles to concrete interdisciplinary contexts, thereby exemplifying how different domains of knowledge intersect and inform each other. This integration is crucial for achieving a holistic view of existence, aligning with the Interdisciplinary Synthesis at Level 1."
    },
    {
      "name": "Contextual Relationality",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how entities and concepts within different disciplines relate to one another in various contexts. It connects to Level 2 by examining how specific domains of knowledge interact and influence each other's ontological frameworks. This relational understanding is essential for developing comprehensive ontological frameworks that reflect the interconnected nature of all knowledge, as emphasized by Interdisciplinary Synthesis."
    },
    {
      "name": "Epistemological Implications",
      "description": "This subtopic examines how different epistemological approaches impact the development and validation of ontological frameworks across disciplines. It aligns with Level 2 by considering how specific domains of knowledge acquire, validate, and understand their ontological structures, thereby influencing the broader philosophical lens established at Level 0."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cognitive Foundations",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how cognitive processes and mechanisms shape our understanding of reality within interdisciplinary contexts. It relates to Level 2 by analyzing how specific domains of knowledge process and generate ontological information, reflecting the cognitive science principles that underlie human knowledge acquisition and validation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Practical Applications",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the practical applications of interdisciplinary ontological frameworks in real-world contexts. It integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience, aligning with Practical Wisdom at Level 1. By examining how these frameworks are applied in various fields, it highlights their utility in solving complex problems and making informed decisions."
