      "name": "Interdisciplinary Ontological Frameworks",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the development of ontological frameworks that integrate concepts from multiple disciplines. It examines how different ontological perspectives (e.g., essentialism, nominalism) are adapted and reconciled in interdisciplinary contexts, ensuring a coherent understanding of reality across various fields."

    {
      "name": "Reality and Existence in Interdisciplinary Studies",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the nature of reality and existence as they are perceived and studied across various disciplines. It investigates how different fields (e.g., physics, biology, philosophy) contribute to our understanding of being and how these contributions intersect and inform one another."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ontological Implications for Knowledge Integration",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the ontological implications of integrating knowledge from multiple domains. It examines how different ontological assumptions influence the integration process, ensuring that the resulting synthesis is both coherent and comprehensive."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cognitive and Epistemological Aspects of Interdisciplinary Ontology",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the cognitive and epistemological aspects of developing and applying ontological frameworks in interdisciplinary contexts. It examines how cognitive biases, epistemological assumptions, and methodological approaches shape our understanding of reality when integrating knowledge from diverse fields."

    {
      "name": "Practical Applications of Interdisciplinary Ontology",
      "description": "This subtopic highlights the practical applications of ontological considerations in interdisciplinary contexts. It discusses how a unified understanding of reality can inform decision-making, problem-solving, and ethical reasoning across various real-world scenarios."
