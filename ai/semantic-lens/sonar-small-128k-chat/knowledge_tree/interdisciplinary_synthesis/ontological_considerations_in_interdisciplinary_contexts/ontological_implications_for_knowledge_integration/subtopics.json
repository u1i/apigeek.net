      "name": "Existential Foundations",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how the fundamental nature of existence influences the integration of knowledge. It examines how different ontological perspectives (e.g., realism, nominalism) shape our understanding of reality and, consequently, how this impacts the synthesis of knowledge across various domains."
    },
    {
      "name": "Relational Structures",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the relationships between entities and concepts within an integrated knowledge framework. It considers how ontological relations (e.g., substance-attribute, part-whole) facilitate or hinder the coherence and consistency of knowledge across different disciplines."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cognitive and Epistemological Alignments",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how cognitive processes and epistemological principles align with ontological considerations. It examines how our understanding of perception, memory, and learning influences our ability to integrate knowledge from diverse domains."
    },
    {
      "name": "Practical Applications and Implications",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the practical implications of integrating knowledge with ontological considerations. It explores how a comprehensive understanding of existence and reality can inform decision-making, problem-solving, and ethical reasoning in real-world contexts."
