      "description": "This topic falls under the Ontology domain, which is a fundamental aspect of our philosophical framework. It explores the nature of existence and reality, integrating with Epistemology to understand how we acquire and validate knowledge about reality. It also intersects with Cognitive Science to comprehend how humans perceive and process information about reality."
