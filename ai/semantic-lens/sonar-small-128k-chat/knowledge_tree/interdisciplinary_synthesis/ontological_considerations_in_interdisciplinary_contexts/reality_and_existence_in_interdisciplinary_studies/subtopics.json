      "name": "Ontological Foundations",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the fundamental nature of existence and reality across various disciplines. It examines how different fields, such as philosophy, science, and cognitive science, conceptualize being and its attributes. This analysis is crucial for understanding the ontological underpinnings of interdisciplinary studies, which is essential for integrating knowledge from multiple domains."

    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Realism",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the real-world implications of interdisciplinary research on our understanding of reality. It considers how combining insights from multiple domains can provide a more comprehensive view of existence, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of such approaches. This subtopic aligns with the practical wisdom aspect by focusing on the application of knowledge in real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cognitive and Epistemological Aspects",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how cognitive processes and epistemological frameworks influence our understanding of reality within interdisciplinary contexts. It examines how perception, attention, memory, and learning mechanisms shape our comprehension of existence across different disciplines. This analysis is vital for understanding how humans process and generate knowledge in an interdisciplinary setting."
    },
    {
      "name": "Philosophical and Methodological Considerations",
      "description": "This subtopic addresses the philosophical and methodological challenges inherent in studying reality and existence through an interdisciplinary lens. It explores the foundational questions about knowledge acquisition, validation, and understanding within this context, drawing from epistemology and philosophy of science. This subtopic ensures that the integration of knowledge is grounded in sound philosophical principles."
