      "name": "Integration of Cognitive Processes",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how cognitive processes such as perception, attention, and memory contribute to the formation and validation of ontological knowledge in interdisciplinary contexts. It examines how these processes facilitate the integration of diverse perspectives and data, aligning with the Cognitive Science domain and its role in understanding human knowledge generation."

    {
      "name": "Epistemological Foundations of Interdisciplinary Knowledge",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the epistemological principles that underpin the creation and validation of knowledge across multiple disciplines. It considers how different sources of knowledge (e.g., empirical data, theoretical frameworks) are evaluated and integrated, reflecting the Epistemology domain's focus on knowledge acquisition and validation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ontological Frameworks for Interdisciplinary Synthesis",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates the ontological frameworks necessary for synthesizing knowledge from various disciplines. It examines how concepts like substance, attribute, and relation are applied to create a coherent understanding of reality that accommodates diverse perspectives, aligning with the Ontology domain's study of existence and reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Practical Applications in Interdisciplinary Research",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how the cognitive and epistemological aspects of interdisciplinary ontology are applied in real-world research contexts. It considers practical challenges such as decision-making, problem-solving, and ethical reasoning within interdisciplinary projects, reflecting the Practical Wisdom domain's focus on applying knowledge in practical contexts."
