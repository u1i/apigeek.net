      "name": "Decision-Making in Complex Systems",
      "description": "This subtopic involves the application of practical wisdom to make informed decisions within complex systems. It integrates insights from cognitive science on how humans process information, ontological understanding of the dynamic nature of reality, and epistemological considerations about the limits and sources of knowledge. By synthesizing knowledge from multiple domains, decision-makers can navigate intricate problems effectively."

    {
      "name": "Ethical Reasoning in Real-World Contexts",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the ethical dimensions of practical wisdom. It draws upon philosophical discussions about the nature of being (ontology) and the foundations of scientific inquiry (philosophy of science) to inform ethical decision-making. By integrating theoretical understanding with practical experience, individuals can develop a nuanced approach to ethical reasoning that is grounded in both abstract principles and concrete applications."

    {
      "name": "Problem-Solving Across Disciplinary Boundaries",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the ability to solve problems that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. It leverages cognitive science's understanding of human intelligence and learning processes, ontology's exploration of existence and reality, and epistemology's study of knowledge acquisition and validation. By fostering an interdisciplinary approach, problem-solvers can develop innovative solutions that address complex issues holistically."
    },
    {
      "name": "Integration of Theoretical Knowledge with Practical Experience",
      "description": "This subtopic highlights the importance of bridging theoretical knowledge with practical experience. It involves applying philosophical frameworks like epistemology and ontology to real-world scenarios, while also drawing upon cognitive science's insights into human cognition. This integration enables practitioners to translate abstract concepts into actionable strategies that yield tangible results."
