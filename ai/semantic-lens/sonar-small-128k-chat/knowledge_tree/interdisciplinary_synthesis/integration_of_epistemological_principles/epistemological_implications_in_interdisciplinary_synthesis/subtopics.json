    {
      "name": "Integration of Epistemological Principles",
      "description": "This subtopic involves the systematic incorporation of epistemological principles into interdisciplinary synthesis. It examines how the foundational questions of knowledge acquisition, validation, and understanding are applied across multiple domains to form a cohesive understanding. This integration ensures that the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge are consistently considered in the synthesis process."
    },
    {
      "name": "Validation Across Disciplines",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the validation of knowledge within interdisciplinary contexts. It explores how different disciplines contribute to the validation process, ensuring that knowledge is not only accurate but also relevant and applicable across various fields. This validation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of knowledge in synthesis."
    },
    {
      "name": "Contextual Understanding",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the importance of contextual understanding in interdisciplinary synthesis. It highlights how knowledge must be understood within its specific context to ensure that it is relevant and applicable. This contextual understanding is rooted in both epistemological principles and practical wisdom, integrating theoretical knowledge with real-world applications."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Communication",
      "description": "This subtopic addresses the challenges and opportunities of communication between different disciplines during interdisciplinary synthesis. It explores how effective communication can facilitate the integration of diverse epistemological perspectives, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of complex problems."
