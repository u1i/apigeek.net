      "description": "Knowledge Reliability is a critical aspect of Epistemology, which is foundational to our overall framework. It is deeply intertwined with Ontology, as understanding the nature of reality is essential for assessing knowledge reliability. Cognitive Science provides insights into how humans process and generate reliable knowledge, while Philosophy of Science examines the methods and implications of scientific inquiry that contribute to reliable knowledge. Practical Wisdom integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience to ensure that knowledge is applied reliably in real-world contexts."
