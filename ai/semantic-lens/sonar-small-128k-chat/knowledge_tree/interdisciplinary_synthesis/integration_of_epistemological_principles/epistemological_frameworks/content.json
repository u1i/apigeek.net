      "description": "Epistemological frameworks are integral to the study of knowledge, fitting into the broader context of our philosophical framework by providing foundational principles for understanding how knowledge is acquired, validated, and understood. This domain is a key component of Level 1 (Major Components) and is essential for integrating with other domains like Ontology and Cognitive Science at Level 2 (Specific Domains)."

        "description": "The development of robust epistemological frameworks has significant implications for knowledge organization. It ensures that knowledge is systematically validated and understood, leading to more reliable and trustworthy information across all domains. This, in turn, enhances interdisciplinary synthesis by providing a common language and set of principles for integrating diverse fields of study."
