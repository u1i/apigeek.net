      "description": "Validation Methods is a crucial aspect of Epistemology, which is the foundational domain that studies the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. It is part of the broader framework that encompasses how we acquire, validate, and understand knowledge. This topic exemplifies how Epistemological principles are applied in real-world contexts, integrating with other domains like Cognitive Science and Philosophy of Science to form a comprehensive understanding."
