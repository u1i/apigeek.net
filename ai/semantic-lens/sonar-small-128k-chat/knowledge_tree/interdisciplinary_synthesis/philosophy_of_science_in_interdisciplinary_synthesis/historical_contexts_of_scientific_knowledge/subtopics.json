    {
      "name": "Cultural and Social Influences on Science",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into how cultural and social factors have shaped scientific inquiry. It considers how societal norms, political climates, and cultural values have impacted the pursuit of scientific knowledge, drawing from Cognitive Science (the mind and intelligence) to understand how these influences affect human perception and understanding."
    },
    {
      "name": "Historical Figures and Their Contributions",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the contributions of key historical figures in science. It analyzes how individual scientists' work was influenced by their time period and how their discoveries fit into the broader historical context, integrating insights from Ontology (the nature of existence) to understand the significance of these contributions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Methodological Developments and Innovations",
      "description": "This subtopic examines the methodological advancements that have occurred throughout the history of science. It explores how new tools, techniques, and experimental designs have enabled scientists to gather and interpret data more effectively, aligning with the practical wisdom needed for real-world applications."
