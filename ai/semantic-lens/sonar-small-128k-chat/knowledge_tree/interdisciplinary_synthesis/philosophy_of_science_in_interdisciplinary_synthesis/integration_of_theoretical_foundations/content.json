      "description": "Integration of Theoretical Foundations is a critical component of Interdisciplinary Synthesis, which emphasizes the holistic understanding of knowledge. It aligns with the Epistemology domain by examining how different theoretical frameworks contribute to our understanding of knowledge. This process is essential for Ontology as it helps in defining the nature of reality by integrating various theoretical perspectives. Cognitive Science informs this integration by providing insights into how humans process and generate knowledge, while Philosophy of Science evaluates the methods and implications of integrating these theories."
