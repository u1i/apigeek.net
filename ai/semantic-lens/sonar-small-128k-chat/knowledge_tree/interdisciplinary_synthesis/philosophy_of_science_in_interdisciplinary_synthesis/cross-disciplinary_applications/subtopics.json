      "name": "Integration of Theoretical Knowledge",
      "description": "This subtopic involves the application of theoretical frameworks from various disciplines to real-world problems. It leverages the foundational principles established in Level 0 (Fundamental Worldview/Framework) and the major components outlined in Level 1 (Major Components). For instance, integrating epistemological insights into cognitive science helps understand how knowledge is processed and validated, which is crucial for practical wisdom in decision-making and problem-solving."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Methodologies",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the development and use of methodologies that combine insights from multiple domains. It builds upon the interdisciplinary synthesis principles at Level 2, ensuring that knowledge is not compartmentalized but rather integrated to address complex issues. For example, using philosophical of science methods to analyze data across different fields enhances the validity and reliability of cross-disciplinary applications."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations in Application",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the ethical implications of applying knowledge across disciplines. It aligns with practical wisdom by ensuring that decisions and actions are not only informed by theoretical understanding but also guided by ethical principles. By considering ontology's focus on existence and reality, ethical considerations can be grounded in a deeper understanding of the consequences of actions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Holistic Problem-Solving Approaches",
      "description": "This subtopic promotes holistic approaches to problem-solving by integrating knowledge from various domains. It reflects the interdisciplinary synthesis at Level 2, recognizing that complex problems often require a comprehensive understanding that transcends single-discipline perspectives. By combining insights from cognitive science, philosophy of science, and practical wisdom, holistic approaches can lead to more effective solutions."
