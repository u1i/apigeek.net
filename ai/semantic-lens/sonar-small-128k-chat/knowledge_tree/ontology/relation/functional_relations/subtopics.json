    {
      "name": "Causal Relations",
      "description": "Causal relations examine how events or actions lead to other events or outcomes. This subtopic is crucial in ontology as it helps understand the dynamic nature of reality and how entities interact. It also intersects with epistemology by questioning how we can infer causality from observed phenomena, thereby validating our understanding of functional relations."
    },
    {
      "name": "Teleological Relations",
      "description": "Teleological relations focus on the purpose or function of entities within a system. This subtopic is essential in ontology as it explores the intrinsic and extrinsic goals that define the behavior of entities. It also ties into cognitive science by understanding how humans perceive and interpret functional purposes, influencing their decision-making processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Structural Relations",
      "description": "Structural relations investigate the organizational patterns within systems, including hierarchies, networks, and other configurations. This subtopic is vital in ontology as it reveals the underlying structures that govern existence. It also intersects with philosophy of science by examining how scientific models represent these structures, thereby informing our understanding of functional relations."
    },
    {
      "name": "Normative Relations",
      "description": "Normative relations concern the standards or rules that govern the behavior of entities within a system. This subtopic is significant in ontology as it delves into the ethical and moral frameworks that shape reality. It also ties into practical wisdom by understanding how norms influence decision-making and problem-solving in real-world contexts."
