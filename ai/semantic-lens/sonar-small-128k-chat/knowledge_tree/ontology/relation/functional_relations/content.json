      "description": "Functional Relations is a specific domain within the Ontology category, which is part of the broader framework. It explores the nature of being and reality by examining functional relationships between entities, attributes, and concepts. This domain exemplifies Level 2 by mapping abstract principles of ontology to concrete fields of study."

      {
        "name": "Entity-Attribute Relations",
        "explanation": "The study of how entities possess attributes and how these attributes relate to each other. This concept is fundamental in understanding the structure of knowledge within ontology."

      {
        "name": "Functional Dependencies",
        "explanation": "The analysis of how one attribute or entity depends on another for its existence or functionality. This concept is crucial in defining the interdependencies within systems and structures."

        "name": "Causal Relations",
        "explanation": "The examination of cause-and-effect relationships between entities or attributes. This concept helps in understanding the dynamics and evolution of systems over time."

      {
        "name": "Holism",

        "name": "Contextualism",
        "description": "The principle that meaning and functionality are context-dependent. Functional relations must be understood within the specific context in which they operate, as their significance can vary greatly depending on the situation."
      },
      {
        "name": "Systemicity",
        "description": "The principle that complex systems exhibit emergent properties that cannot be predicted by analyzing individual components alone. Functional relations highlight how these emergent properties arise from interactions between entities."
