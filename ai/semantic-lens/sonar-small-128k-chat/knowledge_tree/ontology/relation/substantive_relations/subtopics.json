    {
      "name": "Essential Properties",
      "description": "Essential properties are attributes that define the very nature of a thing. They are fundamental to understanding substantive relations because they help identify what makes something what it is. This concept aligns with ontology's focus on existence and reality, as it delves into the intrinsic characteristics that distinguish one entity from another."
    },
    {
      "name": "Accidental Properties",
      "description": "Accidental properties are attributes that do not define the essential nature of a thing but can still be relevant in understanding substantive relations. They highlight how entities can change or vary without altering their fundamental identity. This subtopic intersects with epistemology by considering how we perceive and validate these properties in our knowledge acquisition processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Causal Relations",
      "description": "Causal relations explore how one entity affects another, which is crucial for understanding substantive relations. This subtopic integrates with philosophy of science by examining the mechanisms and laws governing these interactions, providing insights into the scientific method's application in various domains."
    },
    {
      "name": "Temporal Relations",
      "description": "Temporal relations examine how entities change over time, which is essential for grasping dynamic substantive relations. This subtopic aligns with cognitive science by considering how our perception of time influences our understanding of these changes and how they impact our knowledge generation processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Spatial Relations",
      "description": "Spatial relations focus on how entities occupy space relative to each other, which is fundamental for understanding spatially dependent substantive relations. This subtopic intersects with practical wisdom by considering how spatial arrangements influence decision-making and problem-solving in real-world contexts."
