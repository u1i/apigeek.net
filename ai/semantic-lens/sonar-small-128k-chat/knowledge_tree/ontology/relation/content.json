      "description": "Relation is a fundamental concept within the Ontology domain, which studies existence and reality. It is crucial for understanding the structure and content of knowledge. At Level 1, Relation manifests as a primary aspect of Ontology, breaking down into its primary aspects such as substance, attribute, and relation itself."
