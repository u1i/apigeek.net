      "description": "Spatial Configuration is a fundamental concept within the domain of Ontology, which studies existence and reality. It is part of the broader framework that explores the nature of being, including concepts like substance, attribute, and relation. This topic exemplifies Level 2 by mapping abstract principles to concrete fields, specifically in the context of spatial relationships and configurations."
