    {
      "name": "Time and Change",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the fundamental nature of time and change, examining how temporal concepts influence our understanding of existence and reality. It delves into questions about the flow of time, the relationship between past, present, and future, and how these dynamics shape our perception of the world."
    },
    {
      "name": "Temporal Relations",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the relationships between different temporal entities, such as causality, sequence, and duration. It integrates insights from ontology to understand how temporal relations structure our experience of reality and inform our cognitive processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Temporal Perception and Cognition",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how humans perceive and process temporal information, drawing from cognitive science to understand the neural mechanisms and psychological factors that influence our temporal awareness. It also considers how temporal perception affects our practical wisdom in decision-making and problem-solving."
    },
    {
      "name": "Historical Contexts",
      "description": "This subtopic examines how temporal dynamics shape historical contexts, including the role of time in historical narratives, the impact of temporal perspectives on historical interpretation, and how historical events are influenced by their temporal setting."
    },
    {
      "name": "Philosophy of Time in Science",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how temporal dynamics are conceptualized within scientific frameworks, including discussions on time in physics (e.g., relativity), biology (e.g., evolutionary timelines), and other scientific disciplines. It highlights the interplay between philosophical and scientific understandings of time."
