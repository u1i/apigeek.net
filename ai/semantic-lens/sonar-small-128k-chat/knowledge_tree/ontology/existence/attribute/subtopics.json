    {
      "name": "Essential Attributes",
      "description": "Essential attributes are those that define the very essence of an entity. They are fundamental to understanding the intrinsic nature of being and are crucial for ontological analysis. This subtopic relates to Level 0 by establishing core organizing principles and to Level 1 by breaking down ontology into its primary aspects."
    },
    {
      "name": "Accidental Attributes",
      "description": "Accidental attributes are those that do not define the essence of an entity but rather describe its contingent properties. This subtopic is essential for understanding how attributes can vary and change, which is critical in both ontology and epistemology. It also integrates with cognitive science by highlighting how our perception and understanding of attributes can influence our knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Relational Attributes",
      "description": "Relational attributes describe how entities interact with each other. This subtopic is vital for understanding complex systems and relationships, which is a key aspect of both ontology and practical wisdom. It also intersects with philosophy of science by examining how relational attributes are studied and understood within scientific frameworks."
    },
    {
      "name": "Modal Attributes",
      "description": "Modal attributes concern the possibilities and necessities that pertain to an entity's attributes. This subtopic is fundamental for understanding the modal logic of attributes, which is essential for both ontological analysis and epistemological inquiry. It also integrates with cognitive science by exploring how our understanding of modal attributes influences our reasoning and decision-making processes."
