      "name": "Substantive Relations",
      "description": "Substantive relations refer to the inherent connections between entities, such as causality, similarity, and identity. These relations are fundamental to understanding the structure of existence and reality (Ontology). They are essential for validating knowledge claims in various domains, including Epistemology and Cognitive Science."
    },
    {
      "name": "Functional Relations",
      "description": "Functional relations describe how entities interact and influence one another. This includes concepts like causation, dependency, and reciprocity. These relations are crucial for understanding complex systems and processes in fields like Philosophy of Science and Practical Wisdom."
    },
    {
      "name": "Temporal Relations",
      "description": "Temporal relations pertain to the ordering of events and their duration. They are vital for understanding historical contexts and the evolution of knowledge over time. Temporal relations integrate with Cognitive Science to explain how memory and learning processes shape our understanding of the past and future."
    },
    {
      "name": "Spatial Relations",
      "description": "Spatial relations concern the geometric and topological relationships between entities in space. These are essential for mapping and understanding physical environments, which is critical in fields like Cognitive Science for perception and navigation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Logical Relations",
      "description": "Logical relations involve the connections between propositions or statements. They are fundamental to Epistemology for validating arguments and constructing logical frameworks that underpin scientific inquiry (Philosophy of Science). Logical relations also play a role in Practical Wisdom by guiding decision-making processes."
