      {
        "name": "Substance",
        "explanation": "A substance is a fundamental entity that exists independently and has inherent properties. It is the primary subject of ontology, providing the foundation for understanding reality."

        "name": "Identity",
        "explanation": "Identity refers to the unique characteristics or properties that define a substance. It is crucial for distinguishing one substance from another and for understanding how substances persist over time."

        "name": "Essentialism",
        "explanation": "Essentialism is the philosophical position that substances have essential properties that define their identity. This concept is central to discussions about substance identity, as it helps determine what makes a substance what it is."

      {
        "name": "The Principle of Uniqueness of Identity",
        "description": "This principle asserts that each substance has a unique identity, which cannot be shared with any other substance. It ensures that each substance can be distinguished from others based on its essential properties."

      {
        "description": "The concept of substance identity has significant implications for knowledge organization. It helps establish clear criteria for distinguishing between different entities, which is crucial in various fields such as biology, chemistry, and philosophy. This clarity ensures that knowledge is organized in a coherent and meaningful way."
