      "name": "Modality",
      "description": "Modality refers to the modes or ways in which accidental properties can exist or be perceived. This includes concepts like possibility, necessity, and contingency. Understanding modality helps in grasping how accidental properties can vary and how they relate to the broader ontological framework, which is essential for Level 0's fundamental worldview."
    },
    {
      "name": "Temporal and Spatial Relations",
      "description": "Temporal and spatial relations pertain to how accidental properties change over time and their spatial distribution. This subtopic integrates with Cognitive Science by examining how humans perceive and understand these changes, and with Philosophy of Science by considering the methods used to study temporal and spatial phenomena. It also aligns with Practical Wisdom by recognizing the practical implications of understanding these relations in real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Causal Relationships",
      "description": "Causal relationships explore how accidental properties influence one another or the world around them. This subtopic intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the scientific methods used to identify causal links and with Cognitive Science by understanding how humans infer causality from observations. It also contributes to Practical Wisdom by informing decision-making processes that rely on understanding causal relationships."
    },
    {
      "name": "Essential vs. Accidental Distinction",
      "description": "The essential vs. accidental distinction is crucial for understanding what constitutes an accidental property. This subtopic delves into the ontological nature of being, distinguishing between properties that are inherent to a thing's essence and those that are merely contingent. It aligns with Level 1's major components by breaking down the ontology of substance into its primary aspects and with Level 0's fundamental worldview by establishing core organizing principles."
