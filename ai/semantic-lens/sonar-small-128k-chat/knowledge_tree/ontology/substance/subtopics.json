    {
      "name": "Essential Properties",
      "description": "Essential properties are those attributes that define a substance and cannot be removed without changing its fundamental nature. This subtopic relates to ontology by exploring what makes a substance what it is, aligning with the study of existence and reality. It also connects to epistemology by questioning how we determine these essential properties and validate our understanding of them."
    },
    {
      "name": "Accidental Properties",
      "description": "Accidental properties are attributes that a substance may possess but do not define its essential nature. This subtopic is crucial in ontology as it distinguishes between inherent and extrinsic characteristics of a substance. It also intersects with cognitive science by considering how humans perceive and categorize these properties, influencing how we generate and process knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Substantial Change",
      "description": "Substantial change refers to the transformation of one substance into another, which is a fundamental concept in ontology. This subtopic relates to epistemology by examining the conditions under which such changes occur and how we understand these transformations. It also ties into practical wisdom by considering the implications of substantial change in real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Substance Identity",
      "description": "Substance identity deals with the question of whether a substance remains the same over time despite changes in its properties. This subtopic is central in ontology as it addresses the persistence of substances and their continuity. It also intersects with philosophy of science by considering the scientific methods used to determine substance identity and its implications for our understanding of reality."
