    {
      "name": "Essential Attributes",
      "description": "Essential attributes are those that define the very nature of an entity. They are fundamental to understanding the ontology of being and are essential for categorizing and distinguishing between different entities. This subtopic relates to Level 0 by establishing the core principles of existence and reality, and to Level 2 by mapping these abstract principles to concrete fields like metaphysics."
    },
    {
      "name": "Accidental Attributes",
      "description": "Accidental attributes are those that do not define the essential nature of an entity but rather describe its contingent properties. This subtopic is crucial for understanding how attributes can change over time and how they relate to the dynamic nature of reality, aligning with Level 0's focus on fundamental worldview and Level 2's concrete fields like philosophy of science."
    },
    {
      "name": "Relational Attributes",
      "description": "Relational attributes describe how entities interact with each other. This subtopic is essential for understanding complex systems and networks, which is relevant to Level 1's cognitive science domain as it involves understanding how minds process information about relationships. It also aligns with Level 0 by emphasizing interconnectedness."
    },
    {
      "name": "Modal Attributes",
      "description": "Modal attributes deal with possibility, necessity, and other modalities. This subtopic is critical for understanding the logical structure of knowledge and how it applies to various domains like philosophy of science, where modal logic is used to analyze scientific hypotheses. It relates to Level 0 by providing a foundational framework for logical reasoning."
