      "description": "Essential Attributes is a concept within the domain of Ontology, which is part of the broader framework of knowledge organization. It falls under the category of Attribute, which is a fundamental concept in understanding the structure and content of knowledge. This topic exemplifies how abstract principles (Ontology) are mapped to concrete fields (Attribute) at Level 2 of our knowledge structure."

        "name": "Substance",

        "name": "Relation",
        "explanation": "Relations describe how substances interact or are related to each other. Essential attributes can also involve relations that define how substances exist in relation to other substances."

      {
        "description": "Understanding essential attributes helps in organizing knowledge by providing a clear and consistent framework for describing and categorizing substances. This clarity is crucial for interdisciplinary synthesis, as it allows for more precise communication and integration of knowledge across different domains."

        "description": "The study of essential attributes contributes to the development of practical wisdom by providing a solid foundation for decision-making and problem-solving. By understanding what attributes are essential to a substance, one can make more informed decisions about how to interact with or manipulate that substance."
