    {
      "name": "Substantiality",
      "description": "The study of what constitutes the fundamental nature or essence of an entity. This subtopic relates to ontology by examining the intrinsic properties that define being and existence. It is essential for understanding how attributes contribute to the overall structure of knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Predication",
      "description": "The examination of how attributes are predicated or attributed to entities. This subtopic intersects with epistemology by considering how we validate and understand these attributions, ensuring that knowledge is accurately and meaningfully applied. It also ties into cognitive science by exploring how mental processes handle attributions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Relationality",
      "description": "The investigation into how attributes relate to one another and to the entities they describe. This subtopic is crucial for ontology as it delves into the complex web of relationships within reality, influencing our comprehension of existence and its various facets."
    },
    {
      "name": "Temporal and Spatial Attributes",
      "description": "The analysis of how attributes change over time and space. This subtopic integrates with philosophy of science by considering the dynamic nature of scientific knowledge and its implications for understanding temporal and spatial phenomena. It also aligns with practical wisdom by informing decision-making processes that account for temporal and spatial contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Causal and Teleological Attributes",
      "description": "The exploration of causal relationships and teleological (purpose-oriented) attributes within entities. This subtopic intersects with philosophy of science by examining the causal mechanisms underlying natural phenomena and the teleological aspects of scientific inquiry. It also contributes to practical wisdom by providing insights into cause-and-effect relationships and the pursuit of goals."
