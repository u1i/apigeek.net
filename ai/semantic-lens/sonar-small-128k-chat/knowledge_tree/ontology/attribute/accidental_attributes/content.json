      "description": "Accidental Attributes is a concept within Ontology, which is a fundamental domain in our philosophical framework. It falls under the broader category of Attribute, which is a key aspect of understanding existence and reality. This topic exemplifies how our framework organizes knowledge by breaking down complex concepts into specific domains and subdomains."
