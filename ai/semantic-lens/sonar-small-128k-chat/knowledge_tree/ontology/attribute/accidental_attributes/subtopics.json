      "name": "Temporal Attributes",
      "description": "Temporal attributes refer to properties that change over time, such as age, duration, or frequency. These attributes are essential in understanding how entities evolve and interact within the dynamic context of reality. They relate to ontology by examining the nature of being in a temporal framework, and to epistemology by considering how we validate and understand knowledge about changing states."

    {
      "name": "Spatial Attributes",
      "description": "Spatial attributes pertain to properties related to location, size, shape, and arrangement. These attributes are crucial in cognitive science for understanding how humans perceive and process spatial information. In ontology, they contribute to the study of existence by defining how entities occupy space. Practically, spatial attributes are vital in practical wisdom for decision-making and problem-solving involving physical environments."
    },
    {
      "name": "Causal Attributes",
      "description": "Causal attributes concern properties that influence or are influenced by other entities. They are central in philosophy of science for understanding causal relationships in scientific inquiry. In ontology, causal attributes help define the nature of being by examining how entities interact and affect one another. This understanding is also crucial in practical wisdom for making informed decisions based on causal knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Modal Attributes",
      "description": "Modal attributes involve properties that describe possibility, necessity, or obligation. These attributes are fundamental in ontology for understanding the modal structure of reality. They also intersect with epistemology by considering how we reason about possibilities and necessities. In practical wisdom, modal attributes guide ethical reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty."
