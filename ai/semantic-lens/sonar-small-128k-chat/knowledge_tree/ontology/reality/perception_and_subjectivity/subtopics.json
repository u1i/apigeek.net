      "name": "Subjective Experience",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the nature of subjective experience, including how individual perceptions shape reality. It delves into the role of consciousness, personal biases, and the subjective interpretation of sensory data. This is closely related to Epistemology as it questions how we validate and understand our own experiences, and to Ontology as it examines the existence of subjective realities."
    },
    {
      "name": "Perceptual Processes",
      "description": "This subtopic examines the cognitive processes involved in perception, including attention, memory, and learning. It integrates insights from Cognitive Science to understand how the mind processes sensory information and constructs our understanding of the world. It also relates to Philosophy of Science by considering how scientific methods can inform our understanding of perceptual processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interpretation and Context",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how context influences perception and interpretation. It looks at how cultural, social, and environmental factors shape our understanding of reality. This is integral to Interdisciplinary Synthesis as it highlights the interconnectedness of knowledge across different domains, including Ontology for understanding the impact on our conception of existence."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "This subtopic addresses ethical implications arising from subjective experiences and perceptual processes. It considers issues like objectivity versus subjectivity in decision-making and how ethical reasoning is influenced by individual perceptions. This is closely tied to Practical Wisdom as it involves applying theoretical understanding to real-world ethical dilemmas."
