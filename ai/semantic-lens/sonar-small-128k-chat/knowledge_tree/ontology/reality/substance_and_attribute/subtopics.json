    {
      "name": "Substance",
      "description": "The study of substance in ontology explores what exists independently and persistently. It delves into the nature of being, examining whether substances are material or immaterial. This domain is foundational to understanding reality and is closely tied to epistemology as it influences how we perceive and validate knowledge about the world."
    },
    {
      "name": "Attribute",
      "description": "Attributes in ontology refer to properties or characteristics that substances possess. This includes both essential and accidental attributes. The study of attributes helps in understanding the structure of reality by examining how different attributes relate to each other and to substances. It also intersects with cognitive science as it informs how we categorize and understand the world around us."
    },
    {
      "name": "Relation",
      "description": "Relations in ontology pertain to the connections between substances and their attributes. This includes both internal relations (e.g., a substance's properties) and external relations (e.g., between different substances). The analysis of relations is crucial for comprehending the complexity of reality and is integral to both ontology and epistemology as it shapes our understanding of knowledge structures."
    },
    {
      "name": "Essential vs. Accidental Attributes",
      "description": "This subtopic distinguishes between essential attributes that define a substance's nature and accidental attributes that are merely contingent. Understanding this distinction is vital for ontology as it helps in categorizing substances accurately and for epistemology as it influences how we validate knowledge claims about substances."
