      "description": "The study of what constitutes the fundamental nature of reality, including discussions on whether existence is composed of discrete entities or continuous processes. This subtopic relates to ontology by examining the basic building blocks of existence and how they interact, which is essential for understanding the structure and content of knowledge."

      "name": "Attribute",
      "description": "An exploration of the qualities or characteristics that define entities within existence. Attributes help in understanding how entities relate to each other and how they are perceived, which ties back to cognitive science by influencing how we process and generate knowledge about the world."

      "name": "Temporal and Spatial Dimensions",
      "description": "An investigation into how existence unfolds over time and is organized in space. This subtopic is vital for understanding the dynamic nature of reality, which is foundational for both ontology and cognitive science as it influences our perception and understanding of the world."

      "name": "Existential Conditions",
      "description": "A study of the necessary conditions for something to exist, including discussions on causality, necessity, and possibility. This subtopic is essential for epistemology as it helps in validating knowledge claims by providing a framework for understanding what must be true for something to be considered real."
