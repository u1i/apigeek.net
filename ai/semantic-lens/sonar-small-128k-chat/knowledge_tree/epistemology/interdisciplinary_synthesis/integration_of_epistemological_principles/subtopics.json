      "name": "Synthesis of Epistemological Theories",
      "description": "This subtopic involves the integration of various epistemological theories to form a comprehensive understanding. It relates to Level 1 by breaking down the fundamental principles of epistemology into their primary aspects, such as foundationalism, coherentism, and social constructivism. At Level 2, it maps these abstract principles to concrete fields like philosophy of science and cognitive science, demonstrating how different epistemological theories influence our understanding of knowledge acquisition and validation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Validation Methods Across Domains",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the various methods used to validate knowledge across different domains. It connects to Level 1 by examining how different validation methods (e.g., empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and social consensus) manifest in different fields. At Level 2, it maps these validation methods to specific domains like philosophy of science and practical wisdom, highlighting how each domain employs unique validation techniques to ensure the reliability of knowledge."

    {
      "name": "Contextual Understanding of Knowledge Limits",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into understanding the limits of knowledge within different contexts. It relates to Level 1 by examining how the limits of knowledge (e.g., uncertainty principle, fallibility) manifest in various domains. At Level 2, it maps these limits to specific domains like cognitive science and philosophy of science, demonstrating how recognizing these limits is crucial for generating and applying knowledge effectively."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Approaches to Knowledge Generation",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the interdisciplinary approaches necessary for generating comprehensive knowledge. It connects to Level 1 by integrating principles from multiple domains (epistemology, ontology, cognitive science) to form a holistic understanding. At Level 2, it maps these approaches to specific domains like practical wisdom and interdisciplinary synthesis, highlighting how integrating knowledge from various fields leads to more robust and applicable knowledge."
