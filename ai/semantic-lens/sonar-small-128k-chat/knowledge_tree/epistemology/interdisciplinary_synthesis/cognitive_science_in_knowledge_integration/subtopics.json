    {
      "name": "Perception and Sensory Processing",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how humans perceive and process sensory information, which is fundamental to understanding how knowledge is acquired. It relates to Epistemology by examining the sources of knowledge and how they are initially perceived. It also ties into Cognitive Science by studying the mechanisms of perception and attention."
    },
    {
      "name": "Memory and Learning",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the mechanisms of memory formation and learning processes, crucial for understanding how knowledge is stored and retrieved. It aligns with Epistemology by investigating the nature of knowledge retention and recall. It also fits within Cognitive Science by examining the neural and psychological aspects of memory."
    },
    {
      "name": "Language and Communication",
      "description": "This subtopic examines the role of language in knowledge acquisition and dissemination. It connects to Epistemology by considering how language influences our understanding of reality. It also integrates with Cognitive Science by studying the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension and production."
    },
    {
      "name": "Problem-Solving and Decision-Making",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the cognitive processes involved in solving problems and making decisions, which are essential for practical wisdom. It relates to Epistemology by understanding how knowledge is applied in real-world contexts. It also ties into Cognitive Science by analyzing the mental strategies used in problem-solving."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Mechanisms and Brain Function",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive functions, providing insights into how the brain processes information. It aligns with Cognitive Science by exploring the biological basis of intelligence. It also connects to Epistemology by understanding the biological limits of knowledge acquisition."
