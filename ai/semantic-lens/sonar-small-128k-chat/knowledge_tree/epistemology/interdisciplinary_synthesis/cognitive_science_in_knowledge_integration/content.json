      "description": "Cognitive Science in Knowledge Integration is a specific domain that exemplifies the principles of Epistemology, Ontology, and Interdisciplinary Synthesis. It maps abstract principles from these domains to concrete fields of study, focusing on how humans process and generate knowledge. This topic integrates insights from Epistemology (the nature and sources of knowledge) and Ontology (the nature of existence and reality) to understand cognitive processes. It also aligns with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by integrating knowledge from multiple domains to form a comprehensive understanding of human cognition."
