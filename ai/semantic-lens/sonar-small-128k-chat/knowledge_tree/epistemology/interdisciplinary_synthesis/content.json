      "description": "Interdisciplinary Synthesis is a critical component of our knowledge framework, particularly at Level 1. It integrates knowledge from multiple domains (Epistemology, Ontology, Cognitive Science, Philosophy of Science, and Practical Wisdom) to form a comprehensive understanding. This process highlights the interconnectedness of all knowledge and encourages holistic approaches to complex problems."
