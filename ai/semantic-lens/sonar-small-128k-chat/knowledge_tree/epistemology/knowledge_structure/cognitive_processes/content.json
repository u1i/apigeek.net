      "description": "Cognitive Processes is a specific domain within the broader framework of Epistemology, which studies the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. It is also deeply connected to Cognitive Science, which examines the mind and intelligence. This domain exemplifies how abstract principles (Epistemology) manifest in concrete fields (Cognitive Science)."
