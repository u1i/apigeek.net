    {
      "name": "Perception",
      "description": "The process by which the mind interprets and organizes sensory information from the environment. This subtopic is crucial for understanding how humans acquire knowledge through sensory inputs, aligning with Epistemology's focus on knowledge acquisition and validation. It also intersects with Ontology by exploring the nature of reality as perceived by the individual."
    },
    {
      "name": "Attention and Focus",
      "description": "The mechanisms that allow the mind to selectively concentrate on certain stimuli while ignoring others. This subtopic is essential for Cognitive Science as it delves into how the mind processes information, influencing both perception and memory. It also relates to Practical Wisdom by impacting decision-making and problem-solving abilities."
    },
    {
      "name": "Memory and Learning",
      "description": "The processes involved in storing, retaining, and retrieving information. This subtopic is central to Cognitive Science as it examines how knowledge is stored and retrieved, which is fundamental to understanding human intelligence. It also intersects with Epistemology by exploring how knowledge is validated through memory and learning mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "name": "Language and Communication",
      "description": "The systems and processes used for conveying and understanding information through language. This subtopic is vital for Cognitive Science as it investigates how language influences thought and knowledge acquisition. It also relates to Practical Wisdom by enabling effective communication in real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Problem-Solving and Decision-Making",
      "description": "The strategies and techniques employed to address complex problems or make informed decisions. This subtopic is critical for Practical Wisdom as it integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience, ensuring that knowledge is applied effectively in real-world scenarios."
