      "description": "Epistemological Foundations is a critical component of our philosophical framework, situated under the domain of Epistemology. It provides the foundational principles and concepts necessary for understanding how knowledge is acquired, validated, and understood. This topic is essential for establishing a robust framework for all other domains of knowledge."
