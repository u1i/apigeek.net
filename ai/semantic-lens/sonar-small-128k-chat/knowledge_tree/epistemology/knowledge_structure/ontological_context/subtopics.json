      "name": "Substance and Attribute",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the fundamental nature of being, examining what constitutes a substance (an independent entity) and attributes (qualities or properties) that define and relate to substances. It is essential for understanding the structure and content of knowledge, aligning with the ontological inquiry at Level 0 and manifesting in specific domains like metaphysics at Level 2."
    },
    {
      "name": "Relation and Causality",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the relationships between entities, including causality, which is crucial for understanding how entities interact and influence one another. It integrates with epistemological questions about how we validate knowledge claims and cognitive science's study of perception and problem-solving, forming a comprehensive understanding at Level 2."
    },
    {
      "name": "Existence and Reality",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates the nature of existence and reality, encompassing questions about what exists, how it exists, and what constitutes reality. It is foundational to both epistemology's inquiry into knowledge sources and limits and cognitive science's exploration of human perception and understanding."
    },
    {
      "name": "Identity and Change",
      "description": "This subtopic examines the concepts of identity and change, addressing how entities remain constant over time despite potential changes. It is integral to understanding the stability and continuity of knowledge structures, aligning with both ontological inquiry at Level 0 and practical wisdom's application in real-world contexts at Level 1."
    },
    {
      "name": "Time and Space",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the nature of time and space, considering their roles in shaping our understanding of existence and reality. It intersects with epistemological questions about knowledge acquisition and validation, as well as cognitive science's study of perception and memory, providing a rich context for interdisciplinary synthesis at Level 2."
