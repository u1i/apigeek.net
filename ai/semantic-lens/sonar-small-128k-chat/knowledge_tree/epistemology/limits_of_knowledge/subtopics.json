    {
      "name": "Cognitive Biases",
      "description": "Cognitive biases refer to systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, which can limit our understanding of knowledge. This subtopic is closely related to Epistemology, as it explores how our cognitive processes can lead to errors in acquiring and validating knowledge. It also intersects with Cognitive Science, as it delves into the psychological and neurological factors that influence our perception and interpretation of information."
    },
    {
      "name": "Skepticism and Doubt",
      "description": "Skepticism and doubt are fundamental aspects of Epistemology that question the certainty and reliability of knowledge. This subtopic examines the philosophical traditions of skepticism and how they challenge the limits of knowledge. It also relates to Ontology by considering the nature of reality and how our understanding of it might be incomplete or uncertain."
    },
    {
      "name": "Information Overload and Complexity",
      "description": "Information overload and complexity refer to the challenges posed by the vast amount of data available in modern times. This subtopic is connected to Cognitive Science as it explores how humans process and manage information. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science, as it examines the implications of information overload on scientific inquiry and the reliability of scientific knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Constraints",
      "description": "Ethical constraints refer to the moral and ethical boundaries that limit what we can know or how we can acquire knowledge. This subtopic is closely related to Practical Wisdom, as it involves applying ethical principles in real-world contexts. It also intersects with Epistemology by considering how ethical considerations influence our understanding of knowledge and its sources."
    },
    {
      "name": "Historical and Cultural Contexts",
      "description": "Historical and cultural contexts influence what we consider to be knowledge and how we understand its limits. This subtopic is connected to Ontology by examining how different cultures and historical periods conceptualize reality. It also intersects with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by highlighting the importance of considering multiple perspectives when evaluating the limits of knowledge."
