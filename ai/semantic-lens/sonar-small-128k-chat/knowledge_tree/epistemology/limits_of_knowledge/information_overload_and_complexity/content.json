      "description": "Information Overload and Complexity is a specific domain within the broader framework of Epistemology, particularly focusing on the limits of knowledge. It intersects with Cognitive Science by examining how the human mind processes and manages vast amounts of information. This topic also relates to Philosophy of Science as it considers the implications of scientific inquiry on our understanding of complex systems."
