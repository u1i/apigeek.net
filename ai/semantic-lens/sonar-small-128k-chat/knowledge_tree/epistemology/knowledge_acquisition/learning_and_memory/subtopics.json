    {
      "name": "Cognitive Processes",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the cognitive mechanisms involved in learning and memory, such as attention, perception, and encoding. It relates to Epistemology by examining how these processes contribute to the acquisition of knowledge and understanding. It also ties into Cognitive Science by studying the mental processes that underlie learning and memory."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Mechanisms",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the neural structures and functions that support learning and memory. It connects to Ontology by investigating the existence and reality of these neural mechanisms and their role in knowledge formation. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science by considering the empirical evidence and scientific methods used to understand neural mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "name": "Learning Theories",
      "description": "This subtopic examines various theoretical frameworks that explain how learning occurs, such as behaviorist, cognitive, and constructivist theories. It aligns with Epistemology by questioning the nature of knowledge acquisition and validation through different learning theories. It also integrates with Practical Wisdom by applying these theories to real-world educational contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Memory Types",
      "description": "This subtopic categorizes different types of memory (e.g., short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic) and their characteristics. It relates to Cognitive Science by understanding how these types of memory are processed in the brain. It also ties into Interdisciplinary Synthesis by considering how different types of memory interact and influence overall knowledge retention."
    },
    {
      "name": "Memory Retrieval",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates the processes involved in retrieving information from memory, including factors that influence recall and forgetting. It connects to Epistemology by examining how memory retrieval affects our understanding and validation of knowledge. It also intersects with Practical Wisdom by applying strategies for improving memory retrieval in real-world applications."
