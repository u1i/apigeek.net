    {
      "name": "Perception and Sensory Experience",
      "description": "The process by which we initially acquire knowledge through sensory inputs. This subtopic is rooted in Cognitive Science, exploring how the mind processes and interprets sensory data. It is essential for understanding how we initially form perceptions of the world, which then inform our understanding of reality (Ontology)."
    },
    {
      "name": "Learning and Memory",
      "description": "The mechanisms through which we retain and build upon initial knowledge. This subtopic is deeply connected to Cognitive Science, examining how memory functions and how learning processes shape our understanding. It also intersects with Epistemology, as it addresses how we validate and consolidate knowledge over time."
    },
    {
      "name": "Social and Cultural Influence",
      "description": "The role of social and cultural contexts in shaping our acquisition of knowledge. This subtopic highlights the importance of Practical Wisdom, as it considers how real-world interactions and cultural norms influence what we know and how we know it. It also relates to Ontology, as it explores how collective understanding contributes to our shared reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Critical Thinking and Evaluation",
      "description": "The processes involved in critically evaluating and validating acquired knowledge. This subtopic is central to Epistemology, as it addresses the fundamental questions about how we validate knowledge. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science, as it considers the methods and standards used in scientific inquiry to ensure the reliability of knowledge."
