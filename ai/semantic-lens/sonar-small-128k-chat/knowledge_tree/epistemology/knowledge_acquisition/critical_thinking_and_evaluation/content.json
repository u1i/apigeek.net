      "description": "Critical Thinking and Evaluation is a fundamental aspect of Epistemology, which is the study of the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. It is crucial for understanding how we acquire, validate, and understand knowledge. This domain is essential for integrating with other domains like Ontology (the study of existence and reality) and Cognitive Science (the interdisciplinary study of the mind and intelligence)."
