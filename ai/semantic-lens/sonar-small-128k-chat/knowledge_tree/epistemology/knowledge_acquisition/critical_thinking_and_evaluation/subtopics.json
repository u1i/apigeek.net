      "name": "Analytical Reasoning",
      "description": "Analytical reasoning involves breaking down complex information into its constituent parts to understand the relationships and patterns. This skill is essential for critical thinking as it allows individuals to evaluate evidence and arguments systematically. It relates to Epistemology by examining how knowledge is constructed through logical analysis and to Cognitive Science by understanding how the mind processes information."
    },
    {
      "name": "Argumentation and Logic",
      "description": "Argumentation and logic are crucial for evaluating the validity of claims. This subtopic involves understanding logical fallacies, deductive and inductive reasoning, and the structure of arguments. It connects to Philosophy of Science by examining the scientific method's reliance on logical reasoning and to Practical Wisdom by enabling informed decision-making."
    },
    {
      "name": "Evidence-Based Evaluation",
      "description": "Evidence-based evaluation involves assessing the credibility and reliability of sources. This skill is vital for distinguishing between reliable and unreliable information. It ties back to Epistemology by questioning the sources of knowledge and to Cognitive Science by understanding how perception influences what we consider evidence."
    },
    {
      "name": "Contextual Understanding",
      "description": "Contextual understanding recognizes that knowledge is always situated within a particular context. This subtopic involves considering the historical, cultural, and social factors that influence knowledge claims. It relates to Ontology by acknowledging that reality is multifaceted and to Interdisciplinary Synthesis by integrating knowledge from various domains."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "Ethical considerations in critical thinking involve evaluating arguments not only for their logical soundness but also for their ethical implications. This subtopic ensures that knowledge is applied responsibly and ethically. It connects to Practical Wisdom by guiding ethical decision-making and to Philosophy of Science by examining the ethical dimensions of scientific inquiry."
