    {
      "name": "Sensory Modalities",
      "description": "The study of how different senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) contribute to our understanding of the world. This subtopic relates to Epistemology by examining how sensory data is acquired and validated, and to Cognitive Science by understanding how the brain processes sensory information."
    },
    {
      "name": "Attention and Focus",
      "description": "The mechanisms by which we selectively focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others. This subtopic is crucial for Epistemology as it influences what knowledge we acquire and how we validate it, and for Cognitive Science as it explains how attention affects perception and memory."
    },
    {
      "name": "Perceptual Constancies",
      "description": "The ability to perceive objects and events consistently despite changes in sensory input. This subtopic is fundamental to Ontology as it reveals the underlying structure of reality, and to Cognitive Science as it demonstrates how the brain constructs a stable representation of the world."
    },
    {
      "name": "Illusions and Misperceptions",
      "description": "The study of how our perceptions can be deceived or distorted. This subtopic is essential for Epistemology as it highlights the limits of knowledge acquisition and validation, and for Cognitive Science as it reveals the complexities of human perception."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Correlates of Perception",
      "description": "The investigation into the neural mechanisms that underlie perception. This subtopic integrates with Philosophy of Science by examining the empirical methods used to study perception and its neural correlates, and with Practical Wisdom by understanding how neural mechanisms influence real-world decision-making."
