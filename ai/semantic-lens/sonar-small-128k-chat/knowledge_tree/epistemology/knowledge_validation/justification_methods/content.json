      "description": "Justification Methods is a critical component of Epistemology, which is the foundational domain that studies the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. It falls under the broader category of Knowledge Validation, which is essential for understanding how we acquire and validate knowledge. This topic exemplifies Level 2 by mapping abstract principles of knowledge validation to concrete methods used in various fields."
