    {
      "name": "Logical Reasoning",
      "description": "Logical reasoning involves the use of deductive and inductive logic to justify knowledge claims. This method is foundational in Epistemology as it deals with the validation of knowledge through rational processes. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the logical structures underlying scientific theories."
    },
    {
      "name": "Expert Consensus",
      "description": "Expert consensus relies on the agreement of knowledgeable individuals to validate knowledge claims. This method is practical in nature, aligning with Practical Wisdom by integrating theoretical understanding with real-world expertise. It also reflects Ontology by considering the shared understanding of reality among experts."
