      "name": "Cognitive Strategies",
      "description": "Cognitive strategies involve the mental processes and techniques used to approach and resolve problems. This includes methods like breaking down complex problems into simpler components, using heuristics, and employing active recall. These strategies are rooted in cognitive science, which studies how the mind processes information, and are essential for practical wisdom as they aid in decision-making and problem-solving in real-world contexts."

    {
      "name": "Critical Thinking",
      "description": "Critical thinking is the systematic evaluation and analysis of information to form a judgment. It involves identifying biases, evaluating evidence, and considering multiple perspectives. Critical thinking is fundamental to both epistemology and philosophy of science as it helps validate knowledge claims and assess the reliability of information. In practical wisdom, critical thinking is crucial for making informed decisions and solving complex problems."

    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "Ethical considerations in problem-solving involve evaluating the moral implications of potential solutions. This includes considering the impact on stakeholders, adhering to ethical principles, and ensuring that solutions are just and fair. Ethical reasoning is a key aspect of practical wisdom as it integrates theoretical understanding with real-world applications, ensuring that knowledge is applied responsibly."
