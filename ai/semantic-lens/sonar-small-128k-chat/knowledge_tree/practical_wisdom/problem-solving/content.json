      "description": "Problem-solving is a fundamental aspect of Practical Wisdom, which integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience. It is deeply rooted in Cognitive Science, as it involves processes like perception, attention, memory, and learning. Additionally, it is influenced by Philosophy of Science, as it often involves the application of scientific methods to real-world problems. Problem-solving also intersects with Ontology, as it requires understanding the nature of being and the relationships between entities.",
