      "name": "Cognitive Strategies",
      "description": "Cognitive strategies involve the mental processes and techniques used to approach and resolve problems. This includes methods like breaking down complex problems into simpler ones, using analogies, and employing heuristics. These strategies are rooted in cognitive science's understanding of how the mind processes information and are essential for practical wisdom in real-world contexts."

    {
      "name": "Critical Thinking",
      "description": "Critical thinking is the systematic evaluation and analysis of information to form a judgment. It involves identifying biases, evaluating evidence, and considering multiple perspectives. Critical thinking is fundamental to problem-solving as it ensures that solutions are well-reasoned and based on sound evidence, aligning with the epistemological principles of validation and understanding."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "Ethical considerations in problem-solving involve evaluating the moral implications of potential solutions. This includes assessing the impact on stakeholders, considering fairness and justice, and ensuring that solutions align with ethical principles. Ethical reasoning is crucial for practical wisdom as it integrates theoretical understanding with real-world application."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Approaches",
      "description": "Interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving involve integrating knowledge from multiple domains to address complex issues. This might include combining insights from philosophy of science, cognitive science, and practical wisdom to develop comprehensive solutions. Interdisciplinary synthesis is essential for tackling multifaceted problems that require a holistic understanding."
