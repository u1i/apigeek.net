      "description": "Problem-solving is a fundamental aspect of practical wisdom, which integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience. It is deeply rooted in epistemology, as it involves the acquisition and validation of knowledge to address real-world challenges. Ontologically, problem-solving involves understanding the structure and content of knowledge to identify and resolve issues. Cognitive science provides insights into how humans process and generate knowledge, which is crucial for effective problem-solving. Philosophy of science informs the methods and implications of scientific inquiry, often providing tools for systematic problem-solving. Interdisciplinary synthesis highlights the interconnectedness of all knowledge, making problem-solving a holistic endeavor."
