      "name": "Active Learning",
      "description": "Active learning involves engaging with the material through activities like discussions, problem-solving, and hands-on experiments. This approach aligns with the practical wisdom domain by emphasizing the application of knowledge in real-world contexts. It also integrates with cognitive science by understanding how humans process and generate knowledge through active engagement."
    },
    {
      "name": "Reflective Learning",
      "description": "Reflective learning involves introspection and self-assessment to understand one's own learning process. This method is crucial for practical wisdom as it helps in decision-making and problem-solving by reflecting on past experiences. It also relates to epistemology by questioning the nature of knowledge acquisition and validation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Collaborative Learning",
      "description": "Collaborative learning involves working with others to achieve common learning goals. This approach is essential for practical wisdom as it fosters decision-making and problem-solving through shared experiences and diverse perspectives. It also integrates with cognitive science by understanding how social interactions influence knowledge processing."

    {
      "name": "Adaptive Learning",
      "description": "Adaptive learning involves tailoring educational content to individual students' needs and abilities. This method aligns with the practical wisdom domain by ensuring that knowledge is applied effectively in real-world contexts. It also relates to epistemology by exploring the sources and limits of knowledge in diverse learners."
    },
    {
      "name": "Self-Directed Learning",
      "description": "Self-directed learning involves taking responsibility for one's own education, often through autonomous study plans and self-assessment. This approach is crucial for practical wisdom as it promotes decision-making and problem-solving skills through independent learning strategies. It also integrates with cognitive science by understanding how individuals process and generate knowledge without external guidance."
