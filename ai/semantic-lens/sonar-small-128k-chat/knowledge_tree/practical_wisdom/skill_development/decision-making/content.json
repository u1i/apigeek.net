      "description": "Decision-Making is a fundamental aspect of Practical Wisdom, which integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience. It is situated within the broader context of Epistemology, as it involves the validation and application of knowledge in real-world contexts. Ontology provides the foundational understanding of existence and reality that underpins decision-making processes. Cognitive Science informs how humans process information and make decisions, while Philosophy of Science offers insights into the scientific methods and principles that can guide decision-making."
