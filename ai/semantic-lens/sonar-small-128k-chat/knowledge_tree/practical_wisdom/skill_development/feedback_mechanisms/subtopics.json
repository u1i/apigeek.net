      "name": "Self-Assessment",
      "description": "Self-assessment involves evaluating one's own performance or understanding to identify areas for improvement. This process is crucial in practical wisdom as it integrates theoretical knowledge with real-world experience, allowing individuals to refine their skills and decision-making processes. It relates to epistemology by questioning the validity of one's own knowledge and cognitive science by understanding how self-assessment impacts learning and problem-solving."
    },
    {
      "name": "Peer Review",
      "description": "Peer review involves seeking feedback from others who have expertise in the relevant field. This mechanism is essential in practical wisdom as it provides an external perspective that can validate or challenge one's own understanding. It connects to ontology by examining the nature of reality through shared understanding and to philosophy of science by evaluating the reliability of scientific methods and findings."
    },
    {
      "name": "Reflective Practice",
      "description": "Reflective practice involves actively thinking about and analyzing one's own actions and decisions to learn from them. This process is fundamental in practical wisdom as it fosters continuous improvement and ethical reasoning. It ties into epistemology by questioning the sources of knowledge and cognitive science by understanding how reflection influences memory and learning."
    },
    {
      "name": "Iterative Improvement",
      "description": "Iterative improvement involves making adjustments based on feedback received, leading to a cycle of continuous learning and refinement. This mechanism is critical in practical wisdom as it ensures that knowledge is applied effectively in real-world contexts. It relates to ontology by understanding how existence evolves through iterative processes and to philosophy of science by examining how scientific theories are refined over time."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Synthesis",
      "description": "Interdisciplinary synthesis involves integrating feedback from multiple domains to form a comprehensive understanding. This approach highlights the interconnectedness of all knowledge, encouraging holistic approaches to complex problems. It ties into epistemology by validating knowledge across different domains and cognitive science by understanding how interdisciplinary synthesis impacts problem-solving abilities."
