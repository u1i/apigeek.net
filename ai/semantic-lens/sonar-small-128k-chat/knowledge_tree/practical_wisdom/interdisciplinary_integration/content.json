      "description": "Interdisciplinary Integration is a critical component of our knowledge structure, particularly at Level 1. It represents the process of combining insights and methods from multiple domains to form a comprehensive understanding. This concept is deeply rooted in the Epistemology domain, as it addresses how we acquire and validate knowledge across different fields. It also aligns with the Ontology domain by exploring the nature of being and reality through an integrated lens. Furthermore, it is closely related to Cognitive Science, as it involves understanding how humans process and generate knowledge through interdisciplinary approaches. Additionally, it is influenced by the Philosophy of Science, which examines the foundations and methods of scientific inquiry, often requiring integration with other forms of knowledge. Finally, it exemplifies Practical Wisdom by applying theoretical understanding to real-world contexts through holistic problem-solving."
