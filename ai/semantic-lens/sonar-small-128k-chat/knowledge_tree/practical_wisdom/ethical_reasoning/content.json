      "description": "Ethical Reasoning is a fundamental aspect of Practical Wisdom, which integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience. It is deeply rooted in Epistemology, as it involves the validation and application of knowledge in real-world contexts. Ethical Reasoning also intersects with Ontology by examining the nature of being and existence in ethical dilemmas. Additionally, it leverages insights from Cognitive Science to understand how humans process and generate ethical decisions."
