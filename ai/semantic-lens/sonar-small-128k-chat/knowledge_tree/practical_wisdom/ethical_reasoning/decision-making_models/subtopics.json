    {
      "name": "Heuristics and Biases",
      "description": "Heuristics and Biases explores how mental shortcuts and cognitive biases affect decision-making. This subtopic connects to Cognitive Science by studying how the mind shortcuts through complex information processing. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the limitations of human rationality in scientific inquiry."

      "name": "Group Decision-Making",
      "description": "Group Decision-Making examines how collective processes influence individual and group decisions. This subtopic ties into Cognitive Science by understanding social cognition and group dynamics. It also intersects with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by highlighting the need for holistic approaches in managing complex group decision-making scenarios."
    },
    {
      "name": "Dynamic Decision-Making",
      "description": "Dynamic Decision-Making focuses on adapting decisions in response to changing circumstances. This subtopic connects to Philosophy of Science by understanding how scientific knowledge evolves over time and how it impacts dynamic decision-making processes. It also relates to Practical Wisdom by emphasizing adaptability in real-world contexts."
