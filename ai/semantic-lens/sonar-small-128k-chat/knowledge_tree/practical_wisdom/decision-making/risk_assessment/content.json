      "description": "Risk Assessment is a specific domain within the broader framework of Practical Wisdom. It falls under the category of decision-making, which is a crucial aspect of applying knowledge in real-world contexts. This domain integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience, aligning with the principles of Epistemology and Ontology by examining the nature of risk and its implications on decision-making processes."
