      "name": "Identifying Risks",
      "description": "This subtopic involves the systematic process of identifying potential risks and threats. It aligns with the Epistemology level by questioning how we acquire knowledge about risks, and with Cognitive Science by understanding how humans perceive and process risk information. It also integrates with Practical Wisdom by applying this knowledge in real-world contexts to make informed decisions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Evaluating Risk Likelihood and Impact",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on assessing the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks. It relates to Ontology by examining the nature of risk as a concept and its relationship to reality. It also ties into Philosophy of Science by considering the methods used to evaluate risk, such as statistical analysis and modeling."
    },
    {
      "name": "Mitigating and Managing Risks",
      "description": "This subtopic involves strategies for reducing or managing identified risks. It aligns with Practical Wisdom by applying theoretical understanding to real-world problems, ensuring that decision-making is informed by both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. It also integrates with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by considering multiple perspectives on risk management."
    },
    {
      "name": "Monitoring and Reviewing Risk Assessments",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the ongoing process of monitoring and reviewing risk assessments to ensure they remain relevant and effective. It relates to Epistemology by questioning the limits of knowledge about risks over time, and with Cognitive Science by understanding how human perception and processing of risk information evolve over time."
