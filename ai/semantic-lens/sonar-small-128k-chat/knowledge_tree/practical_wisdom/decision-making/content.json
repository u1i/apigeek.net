      "description": "Decision-Making is a fundamental aspect of Practical Wisdom, which integrates theoretical understanding with practical experience. It is deeply rooted in Epistemology, as it involves the validation and application of knowledge in real-world contexts. Ontology influences Decision-Making by considering the nature of reality and the attributes that guide decision processes. Cognitive Science provides insights into how humans process information and make decisions, while Philosophy of Science examines the scientific methods that inform decision-making in various fields."
