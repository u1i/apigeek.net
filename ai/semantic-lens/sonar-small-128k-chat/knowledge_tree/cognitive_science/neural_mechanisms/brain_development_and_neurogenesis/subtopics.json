      "name": "Neural Proliferation",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the processes by which neural cells are generated and proliferate during brain development. It relates to Cognitive Science by examining how neural mechanisms underlie cognitive functions, and to Ontology by understanding the fundamental existence of neural cells as part of the brain's structure. It also ties into Epistemology by questioning how we can validate and understand these developmental processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neuronal Migration and Organization",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into how newly formed neurons migrate to their appropriate positions in the brain and organize into functional networks. It connects to Cognitive Science through its impact on brain structure and function, to Ontology by examining the existence and organization of neurons, and to Epistemology by considering how we can measure and understand these complex processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Synaptic Plasticity and Synaptogenesis",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how synapses form and change during brain development, influencing neural communication and learning. It aligns with Cognitive Science by understanding how neural mechanisms support cognitive functions, with Ontology by studying the dynamic nature of synaptic connections, and with Epistemology by questioning how we can validate theories about synaptic plasticity."
    },
    {
      "name": "Environmental Influences on Brain Development",
      "description": "This subtopic examines how environmental factors, such as nutrition and exposure to toxins, affect brain development. It integrates with Cognitive Science by understanding how environmental influences impact cognitive outcomes, with Ontology by considering the role of external factors in shaping brain structure, and with Epistemology by evaluating the evidence for these influences."
    },
    {
      "name": "Genetic Regulation of Neurogenesis",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how genetic mechanisms control neurogenesis and brain development. It ties into Cognitive Science by understanding the genetic basis of neural functions, into Ontology by examining the role of genes in determining brain structure, and into Epistemology by questioning how we can validate genetic theories related to neurogenesis."
