      "name": "Neural Adaptation",
      "description": "The ability of neurons to change their structure and function in response to experience, which is fundamental to learning and memory. This concept aligns with Cognitive Science's focus on how the mind processes information and integrates with Epistemology's study of knowledge acquisition."
    },
    {
      "name": "Synaptic Strengthening",
      "description": "The process by which neural connections are reinforced based on activity patterns, enabling efficient transmission of signals. This process is crucial for understanding how knowledge is consolidated and retrieved, linking to both Cognitive Science's study of neural mechanisms and Philosophy of Science's examination of scientific inquiry methods."
    },
    {
      "name": "Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)",
      "description": "A specific form of synaptic strengthening that is thought to be a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory. LTP's discovery has significant implications for our understanding of knowledge retention and retrieval, bridging Cognitive Science with Practical Wisdom's focus on real-world applications."
    },
    {
      "name": "Synaptic Depression",
      "description": "The weakening of neural connections due to reduced activity, which is essential for forgetting and reorganizing neural pathways. This concept highlights the dynamic nature of synaptic plasticity, integrating with Ontology's study of existence and reality by illustrating how neural structures can change over time."
    },
    {
      "name": "Mechanisms of Synaptic Plasticity",
      "description": "The molecular and cellular processes involved in synaptic plasticity, including ion channels, neurotransmitters, and signaling pathways. Understanding these mechanisms provides a deeper insight into how knowledge is processed at a fundamental level, aligning with Cognitive Science's interdisciplinary approach and Epistemology's foundational framework."
