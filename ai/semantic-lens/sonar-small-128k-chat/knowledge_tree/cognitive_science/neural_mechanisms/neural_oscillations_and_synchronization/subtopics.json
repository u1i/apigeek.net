    {
      "name": "Frequency Bands",
      "description": "Neural oscillations are categorized into different frequency bands, such as alpha, beta, theta, and gamma waves. These bands are crucial for understanding how different cognitive processes are associated with specific oscillatory patterns. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by examining how neural mechanisms process information and generate knowledge through various frequency bands."
    },
    {
      "name": "Synchronization Mechanisms",
      "description": "The synchronization of neural oscillations is essential for integrating information across different brain regions. This subtopic delves into the mechanisms that facilitate synchronization, such as phase-locking and cross-frequency coupling. It connects to Ontology by exploring the nature of being in terms of synchronized neural activity and its implications for understanding reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Functional Roles",
      "description": "Each frequency band and synchronization mechanism has distinct functional roles in cognitive processes like attention, memory, and perception. This subtopic examines how these roles contribute to our understanding of knowledge acquisition and validation, aligning with Epistemology's focus on the nature and limits of knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Plasticity",
      "description": "Neural oscillations and synchronization are dynamic processes that can change based on experience and learning. This subtopic explores how neural plasticity influences the development of knowledge and its application in real-world contexts, linking to Practical Wisdom by considering the practical implications of dynamic neural processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interdisciplinary Insights",
      "description": "The study of neural oscillations and synchronization often involves interdisciplinary approaches, combining insights from Cognitive Science, Philosophy of Science, and other domains. This subtopic highlights the importance of integrating knowledge from multiple fields to form a comprehensive understanding, reflecting Interdisciplinary Synthesis."
