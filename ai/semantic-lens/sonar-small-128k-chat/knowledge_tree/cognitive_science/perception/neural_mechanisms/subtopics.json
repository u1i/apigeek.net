    {
      "name": "Synaptic Plasticity",
      "description": "The ability of neural connections to change and adapt based on experience, which is crucial for learning and memory. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by explaining how neural mechanisms underlie cognitive processes like perception and problem-solving. It also ties into Epistemology by understanding how knowledge is acquired and stored."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Coding Theories",
      "description": "Theories that explain how neurons represent information, such as rate coding, temporal coding, and population coding. This subtopic is essential for Cognitive Science as it helps understand how the brain processes sensory information and generates knowledge. It also intersects with Ontology by exploring the fundamental nature of information representation in the brain."
    },
    {
      "name": "Brain Regions and Networks",
      "description": "The study of specific brain regions and their interconnected networks, which are vital for understanding how different cognitive functions are localized and integrated. This subtopic aligns with Cognitive Science by mapping brain structures to cognitive functions, and it intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the empirical evidence supporting these mappings."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neurotransmitters and Hormones",
      "description": "The role of chemical messengers in transmitting signals between neurons, which is crucial for regulating various physiological and psychological processes. This subtopic connects to Cognitive Science by understanding how neurotransmitters influence cognitive functions like attention and memory. It also relates to Practical Wisdom by considering how these mechanisms impact decision-making and problem-solving."
    },
    {
      "name": "Computational Models of the Brain",
      "description": "Mathematical and computational models used to simulate brain function, which helps in understanding complex neural dynamics. This subtopic integrates with Cognitive Science by providing tools for simulating cognitive processes, and it intersects with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by combining insights from neuroscience with computational methods."
