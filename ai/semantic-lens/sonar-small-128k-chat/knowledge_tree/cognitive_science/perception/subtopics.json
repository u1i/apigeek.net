    {
      "name": "Sensory Processing",
      "description": "The initial stage of perception where sensory information from the environment is received and processed by the brain. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science as it involves understanding how the mind processes sensory data, and to Epistemology as it questions how we acquire knowledge through sensory experience."
    },
    {
      "name": "Attention and Selectivity",
      "description": "The ability to focus on specific stimuli while ignoring others, which is crucial for efficient information processing. This subtopic connects to Cognitive Science by examining how attention mechanisms influence perception and to Practical Wisdom by highlighting the importance of selective attention in real-world decision-making."
    },
    {
      "name": "Interpretation and Context",
      "description": "The process of assigning meaning to perceived stimuli based on past experiences, cultural background, and environmental context. This subtopic integrates with Ontology by exploring the nature of reality as perceived by the individual and with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by considering how multiple factors influence interpretation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Mechanisms",
      "description": "The study of brain structures and neural pathways involved in perception, which bridges Cognitive Science with Neuroscience to understand the biological basis of perception. This also relates to Epistemology by questioning how neural mechanisms shape our understanding of reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Developmental Aspects",
      "description": "The changes in perception across different stages of human development, from infancy to adulthood. This subtopic aligns with Cognitive Science by examining developmental psychology and with Practical Wisdom by understanding how developmental changes impact real-world interactions."
