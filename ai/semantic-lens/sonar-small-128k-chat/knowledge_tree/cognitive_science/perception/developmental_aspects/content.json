      "epistemology": "Developmental Aspects in Cognitive Science are deeply rooted in epistemology as they explore how knowledge about perception and cognition develops over time. This domain questions the nature of knowledge acquisition and validation in the context of human development.",
      "ontology": "Ontologically, developmental aspects consider the changing nature of being and reality as individuals grow. It examines how attributes like perception and problem-solving evolve with age.",
      "cognitive_science": "Developmental Aspects are a core component of Cognitive Science, focusing on the developmental stages of cognitive processes such as perception, attention, memory, and language.",
      "philosophy_of_science": "Philosophy of Science informs our understanding of developmental aspects by examining the scientific methods used to study cognitive development and the implications of these findings on our understanding of human intelligence.",
      "practical_wisdom": "Practical Wisdom is applied in developmental aspects through the integration of theoretical understanding with practical experience in education and child development."
