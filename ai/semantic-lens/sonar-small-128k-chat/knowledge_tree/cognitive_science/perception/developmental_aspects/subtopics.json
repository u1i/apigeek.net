    {
      "name": "Neural Development",
      "description": "This subtopic explores how the brain and nervous system develop over time, influencing cognitive abilities and sensory perception. It relates to Cognitive Science by examining how neural structures and functions evolve, impacting how we process information. This is also connected to Epistemology as it addresses how our understanding of knowledge changes with developmental stages."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cognitive Milestones",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on significant cognitive achievements in children, such as language acquisition, problem-solving skills, and memory development. It integrates with Cognitive Science by studying the milestones that mark cognitive growth and maturation. It also ties into Practical Wisdom by understanding how these milestones inform decision-making and problem-solving abilities."
    },
    {
      "name": "Environmental Influences",
      "description": "This subtopic examines how environmental factors, including social interactions and cultural contexts, shape cognitive development. It intersects with Ontology by considering the role of external factors in shaping our understanding of reality. It also relates to Interdisciplinary Synthesis by highlighting how multiple domains (environmental, social, cognitive) interact to influence developmental outcomes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Genetic Factors",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates the genetic components that influence cognitive development. It aligns with Ontology by exploring the inherent properties (genetic predispositions) that contribute to our existence and reality. It also connects to Philosophy of Science by understanding how genetic research informs our understanding of scientific knowledge about human development."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cross-Cultural Comparisons",
      "description": "This subtopic compares cognitive development across different cultures, highlighting both universal and culture-specific aspects. It integrates with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by demonstrating how knowledge from multiple domains (cultural studies, cognitive science) can provide a comprehensive understanding of developmental processes."
