    {
      "name": "Neural Encoding",
      "description": "The process by which sensory information is converted into neural signals. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science as it involves understanding how the brain processes sensory data, which is fundamental to how humans generate knowledge. It also ties into Epistemology by examining how these neural signals contribute to our understanding of reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Sensory Modalities",
      "description": "The study of different sensory modalities such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. This subtopic is crucial in Cognitive Science as it helps understand how various senses contribute to our perception of the world. It also intersects with Ontology by exploring the nature of these sensory experiences and how they shape our understanding of existence."
    },
    {
      "name": "Attention and Selectivity",
      "description": "The mechanisms by which the brain selectively focuses on certain sensory inputs while ignoring others. This subtopic is essential in Cognitive Science as it explains how humans filter and prioritize sensory information. It also relates to Practical Wisdom by understanding how attention affects decision-making and problem-solving in real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Sensory Integration",
      "description": "The process of combining information from multiple sensory modalities to form a unified perception. This subtopic is vital in Cognitive Science as it demonstrates how the brain integrates disparate sensory data to create a coherent understanding of reality. It also aligns with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by highlighting the interconnectedness of different sensory inputs."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Plasticity and Adaptation",
      "description": "The ability of the brain to reorganize itself in response to new sensory experiences. This subtopic is significant in Cognitive Science as it shows how sensory processing can change over time based on learning and experience. It also ties into Philosophy of Science by understanding how neural adaptation influences our understanding of scientific knowledge and its methods."
