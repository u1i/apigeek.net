      "name": "Semantic Processing",
      "description": "The process of assigning meaning to sensory inputs, integrating them with prior knowledge, and understanding their context. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by examining how the mind processes and interprets information, aligning with the study of perception and interpretation. It also connects to Epistemology by questioning how we validate and understand the meanings we assign to sensory data."
    },
    {
      "name": "Contextual Understanding",
      "description": "The ability to recognize and utilize the broader context in which information is presented. This subtopic ties into Cognitive Science by highlighting how context influences perception and interpretation. It also intersects with Ontology by exploring the nature of reality and how context shapes our understanding of it."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cultural and Social Influences",
      "description": "The impact of cultural and social factors on interpretation and context. This subtopic integrates with Cognitive Science by showing how cultural and social influences affect perception and interpretation. It also relates to Practical Wisdom by acknowledging that real-world applications often involve navigating diverse cultural contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Mechanisms",
      "description": "The neural processes involved in interpreting and contextualizing information. This subtopic aligns with Cognitive Science by examining the neural mechanisms that underlie perception and interpretation. It also connects to Philosophy of Science by considering the scientific methods used to study these neural processes."

    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "The ethical implications of interpretation and context, such as issues related to bias, accuracy, and fairness. This subtopic ties into Practical Wisdom by emphasizing the importance of ethical reasoning in real-world applications involving interpretation and context."
