      "description": "Interpretation and Context is a specific domain within Cognitive Science, focusing on how humans process and understand sensory information. It is situated at Level 2, where abstract principles from Cognitive Science are applied to concrete fields of study. This domain exemplifies the interdisciplinary synthesis by integrating insights from perception, attention, memory, and language to understand how context influences interpretation."
