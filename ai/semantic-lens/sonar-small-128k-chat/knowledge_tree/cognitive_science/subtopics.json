    {
      "name": "Attention and Memory",
      "description": "The examination of how humans focus attention and retain information. This subtopic integrates with Level 0 by considering the foundational principles of knowledge acquisition and retention. It aligns with Level 1 by dissecting cognitive science into its core components, and with Level 2 by exploring concrete fields like working memory and long-term memory."

    {
      "name": "Language and Communication",
      "description": "The investigation into how humans process and generate language. This subtopic connects with Level 0 by understanding the nature of knowledge representation and expression. It fits within Level 1 by categorizing cognitive science into its primary aspects, and with Level 2 by mapping to specific domains such as linguistics and psycholinguistics."
    },
    {
      "name": "Problem-Solving and Learning",
      "description": "The study of how humans solve problems and learn new information. This subtopic intersects with Level 0 by examining the practical application of knowledge. It aligns with Level 1 by breaking down cognitive science into its core components, and with Level 2 by exploring concrete fields like cognitive development and educational psychology."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Mechanisms",
      "description": "The exploration of the neural processes underlying cognitive functions. This subtopic integrates with Level 0 by understanding the biological basis of knowledge processing. It fits within Level 1 by categorizing cognitive science into its primary aspects, and with Level 2 by mapping to specific domains such as neuroscience and neurocognition."
