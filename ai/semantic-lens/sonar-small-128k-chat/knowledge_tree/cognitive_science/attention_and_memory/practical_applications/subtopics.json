      "name": "Decision-Making",
      "description": "Decision-making involves integrating theoretical knowledge from various domains, such as cognitive science and philosophy of science, to make informed choices in real-world contexts. It requires understanding how humans process information, evaluate evidence, and weigh ethical considerations. This subtopic aligns with the practical wisdom domain by applying theoretical understanding to real-world problems."
    },
    {
      "name": "Problem-Solving",
      "description": "Problem-solving is a critical aspect of practical applications, drawing on cognitive science's insights into perception, attention, and memory. It involves using knowledge from multiple domains to identify and address complex issues. This subtopic exemplifies the interdisciplinary synthesis by integrating knowledge from different areas to tackle practical challenges."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Reasoning",
      "description": "Ethical reasoning is essential for practical applications as it ensures that decisions and actions are morally sound. This subtopic intersects with ontology by considering the nature of being and existence in ethical contexts. It also aligns with epistemology by examining how we validate ethical principles and apply them in real-world scenarios."
    },
    {
      "name": "Skill Development",
      "description": "Skill development is crucial for practical applications as it involves honing skills that can be applied in various contexts. This subtopic relates to cognitive science by focusing on how humans learn and develop skills over time. It also ties into practical wisdom by emphasizing the importance of experiential learning in developing effective skills."
