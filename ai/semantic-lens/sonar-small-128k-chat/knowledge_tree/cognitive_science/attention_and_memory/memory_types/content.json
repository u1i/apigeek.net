        "name": "Short-Term Memory",
        "explanation": "A temporary storage system that holds information for a short period, typically seconds to minutes, before it is either stored in long-term memory or discarded."
      },
      {
        "name": "Long-Term Memory",
        "explanation": "A permanent storage system that retains information over an extended period, often years or even a lifetime."

        "name": "Episodic Memory",
        "explanation": "A type of long-term memory that involves recollections of specific events or experiences."

        "name": "Consolidation",
        "description": "The process by which information is transferred from short-term to long-term memory, often requiring repetition and practice."
