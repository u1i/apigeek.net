    {
      "name": "Attention Mechanisms",
      "description": "Attention Mechanisms explore how the mind selectively focuses on certain stimuli while ignoring others. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by examining how attention influences perception and information processing. It also ties into Epistemology by understanding how selective attention affects knowledge acquisition and validation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Memory Types",
      "description": "Memory Types delve into the different forms of memory, such as short-term and long-term memory. This subtopic is integral to Cognitive Science as it investigates how memory functions and impacts learning and problem-solving. It also intersects with Ontology by considering the nature of stored information and its relationship to reality."
    },
    {
      "name": "Attention-Memory Interplay",
      "description": "Attention-Memory Interplay examines the dynamic relationship between attention and memory. This subtopic is crucial for Cognitive Science as it reveals how attention influences memory formation and retrieval. It also resonates with Philosophy of Science by understanding the scientific methods used to study this interplay and its implications for knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Practical Applications",
      "description": "Practical Applications of Attention and Memory focus on how these cognitive processes are applied in real-world contexts. This subtopic aligns with Practical Wisdom by highlighting the importance of effective attention and memory in decision-making, problem-solving, and ethical reasoning."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Correlates",
      "description": "Neural Correlates of Attention and Memory investigate the brain regions and neural mechanisms involved in these processes. This subtopic is essential for Cognitive Science as it seeks to understand the biological basis of cognitive functions. It also intersects with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by integrating findings from neuroscience with other domains to form a comprehensive understanding."
