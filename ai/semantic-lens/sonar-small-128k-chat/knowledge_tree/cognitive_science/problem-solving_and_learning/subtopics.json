      "name": "Cognitive Processes",
      "description": "Cognitive processes such as perception, attention, memory, and language are fundamental to understanding how humans process and generate knowledge. These processes are essential in Cognitive Science, which helps us comprehend how knowledge is acquired and utilized. This subtopic integrates with Epistemology by examining how cognitive functions contribute to the validation and understanding of knowledge."

    {
      "name": "Learning Theories",
      "description": "Learning theories, including behavioral, cognitive, and social constructivist approaches, provide insights into how humans learn and adapt. These theories are crucial in Cognitive Science for understanding the mechanisms of knowledge acquisition. They also relate to Ontology by exploring the nature of being and how it influences learning processes."

    {
      "name": "Problem-Solving Strategies",
      "description": "Problem-solving strategies involve the application of cognitive skills to resolve complex issues. This subtopic is closely tied to Practical Wisdom as it focuses on the practical application of knowledge in real-world contexts. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the methods and implications of scientific inquiry in solving problems."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Mechanisms",
      "description": "Neural mechanisms underlying problem-solving and learning involve the study of brain functions and structures. This subtopic is deeply rooted in Cognitive Science, which seeks to understand the mind and intelligence. It also relates to Interdisciplinary Synthesis by integrating knowledge from neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy to form a comprehensive understanding of cognitive functions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "Ethical considerations in problem-solving and learning involve evaluating the moral implications of knowledge acquisition and application. This subtopic is essential in Practical Wisdom as it ensures that decision-making and problem-solving are guided by ethical principles. It also intersects with Epistemology by questioning the limits of knowledge and its potential misuse."
