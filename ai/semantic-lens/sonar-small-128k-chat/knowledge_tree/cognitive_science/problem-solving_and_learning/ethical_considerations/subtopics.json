      "name": "Ethical Theories and Models",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into various ethical theories and models, including virtue ethics, care ethics, and distributive justice. It evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each theory and how they apply to real-world scenarios. This connects to Philosophy of Science by examining the empirical evidence supporting different ethical models and to Practical Wisdom by providing frameworks for ethical decision-making in complex situations."
    },
    {
      "name": "Case Studies and Applications",
      "description": "This subtopic involves analyzing real-world case studies to illustrate the practical application of ethical principles.
