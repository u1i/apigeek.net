      "description": "Ethical Considerations in Cognitive Science is a specific domain that exemplifies the intersection of cognitive processes and moral principles. It fits into our overall framework by integrating the study of mind and intelligence (Cognitive Science) with practical wisdom (application of knowledge in real-world contexts). This integration is facilitated by the interdisciplinary synthesis of knowledge from multiple domains, highlighting the interconnectedness of all knowledge."
