    {
      "name": "Synaptic Plasticity",
      "description": "The ability of neural connections to change and adapt based on experience, which is crucial for learning and memory. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by explaining how neural mechanisms support cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning. It also ties into Epistemology by understanding how knowledge is acquired and stored in the brain."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neural Coding Theories",
      "description": "Theories that explain how neurons represent and transmit information, which is essential for understanding how the brain processes sensory data and generates knowledge. This subtopic integrates with Cognitive Science by detailing the mechanisms of perception and attention. It also intersects with Ontology by exploring the nature of information representation in the brain."
    },
    {
      "name": "Brain Regions and Networks",
      "description": "The study of specific brain regions and their interconnected networks, which is vital for understanding how different cognitive functions are localized and coordinated. This subtopic aligns with Cognitive Science by mapping brain structures to cognitive processes. It also resonates with Ontology by examining the existence and organization of brain regions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Neurotransmitters and Hormones",
      "description": "The role of chemical messengers in transmitting signals between neurons, which is fundamental for regulating various cognitive functions. This subtopic connects with Cognitive Science by explaining how neurotransmitters influence learning, memory, and problem-solving. It also intersects with Practical Wisdom by understanding how these chemicals impact decision-making and behavior."
    },
    {
      "name": "Computational Models of the Brain",
      "description": "Mathematical and computational models used to simulate brain function, which helps in understanding complex neural mechanisms. This subtopic integrates with Cognitive Science by providing tools for analyzing neural data. It also ties into Philosophy of Science by examining the scientific methods used in brain modeling."
