    "framework_context": {
      "epistemology": "Psycholinguistics is deeply rooted in epistemology as it seeks to understand how humans acquire and process linguistic knowledge. It questions the nature of language acquisition, the role of cognition in language processing, and how these processes validate our understanding of language.",
      "ontology": "Ontologically, psycholinguistics explores the existence and reality of language as a cognitive construct. It examines the attributes and relations within language that enable communication.",
      "cognitive_science": "Psycholinguistics is a core component of cognitive science, focusing on the mental processes involved in language perception, production, and comprehension. It integrates insights from perception, attention, memory, and problem-solving to understand how humans generate and use language.",
      "philosophy_of_science": "In the context of philosophy of science, psycholinguistics employs scientific methods to study language phenomena. It examines the empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks that underpin our understanding of language acquisition and processing.",
      "practical_wisdom": "Practically, psycholinguistics informs practical wisdom by providing insights into effective communication strategies and language teaching methods. It helps in decision-making related to language education and policy.",
      "interdisciplinary_synthesis": "Psycholinguistics exemplifies interdisciplinary synthesis by integrating knowledge from linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and computer science. It highlights the interconnectedness of cognitive processes with linguistic structures."

      {
        "name": "Language Acquisition",
        "explanation": "The process by which humans learn to understand and produce language. This includes both first and second language acquisition."
      },
      {
        "name": "Cognitive Linguistics",
        "explanation": "An approach that views language as an integral part of cognition. It explores how linguistic structures reflect cognitive processes."
      },
      {
        "name": "Neurolinguistics",
        "explanation": "The study of the neural mechanisms underlying language processing. It examines how brain regions and networks contribute to language functions."

        "name": "Discourse Analysis",
        "explanation": "The examination of language in use, focusing on how people use language in social contexts to convey meaning."

    "major_principles": [
      {
        "name": "Modularity of Language",
        "description": "The idea that language is composed of separate modules or systems that handle different aspects of language processing, such as phonology, syntax, and semantics."
      },
      {
        "name": "Interactionism",
        "description": "The principle that language processing involves dynamic interactions between different cognitive systems and modules."

        "name": "Embodiment",
        "description": "The concept that cognitive processes, including language, are grounded in sensorimotor experiences and bodily interactions with the environment."

    "relationships": [
      {
        "aspect": "Cognitive Science",
        "connection": "Psycholinguistics is closely related to cognitive science as it investigates mental processes involved in language perception and production."
      },
      {
        "aspect": "Linguistics",
        "connection": "Psycholinguistics draws heavily from linguistic theories and methods to understand how language structures are processed in the mind."

      {
        "aspect": "Neuroscience",
        "connection": "Neurolinguistics is a subfield of psycholinguistics that explores the neural mechanisms underlying language functions, connecting it to neuroscience."

    "implications": [
      {
        "broader_impact": "Psycholinguistics has significant implications for education policy by informing effective language teaching methods and materials.",
        "contextual_relation": "It also impacts our understanding of human communication and cognition, contributing to broader discussions in cognitive science and philosophy of mind."
