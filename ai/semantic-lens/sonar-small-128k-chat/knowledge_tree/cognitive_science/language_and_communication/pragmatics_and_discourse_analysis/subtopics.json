      "name": "Contextual Understanding",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on how speakers and listeners use context to convey and interpret meaning. It relates to Epistemology by examining how knowledge is constructed through shared understanding and to Cognitive Science by studying how the mind processes contextual information. It also integrates with Practical Wisdom by understanding how context influences decision-making and communication in real-world scenarios."
    },
    {
      "name": "Speech Acts and Intentions",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the relationship between language and action, examining how speakers use language to perform specific acts like promising or requesting. It ties back to Ontology by considering the nature of reality in terms of social interactions and to Philosophy of Science by understanding the scientific study of language as a form of human behavior. It also aligns with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by recognizing that speech acts are part of a broader understanding of human communication."
    },
    {
      "name": "Discourse Structures and Dynamics",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the organizational patterns of language use in conversations, including turn-taking, dialogue management, and narrative structures. It connects to Cognitive Science by analyzing how these structures reflect cognitive processes like attention and memory. It also intersects with Practical Wisdom by providing insights into effective communication strategies in various contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Power Dynamics and Social Influence",
      "description": "This subtopic examines how language is used to exert power or influence others within social interactions. It relates to Epistemology by questioning whose knowledge is privileged in discourse and to Cognitive Science by understanding how social influence affects cognitive biases. It also aligns with Practical Wisdom by recognizing that power dynamics are crucial in real-world decision-making processes."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cultural Variations in Discourse",
      "description": "This subtopic investigates how different cultures use language differently, highlighting cultural variations in discourse patterns. It ties back to Ontology by exploring the diversity of human existence through linguistic expressions. It also integrates with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by recognizing that cultural differences are essential for a holistic understanding of human communication."
