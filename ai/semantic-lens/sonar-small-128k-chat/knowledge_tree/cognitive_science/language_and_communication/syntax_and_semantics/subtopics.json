      "name": "Phonology and Phonetics",
      "description": "The study of sound systems in language, including the physical properties of speech sounds and their distribution in languages. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by examining how humans perceive and process sound, which is fundamental to understanding language acquisition and processing. It also ties into Epistemology by questioning how we know and understand the sound structures of languages."
    },
    {
      "name": "Morphology",
      "description": "The study of the internal structure of words and how they are formed from smaller units. This subtopic connects to Ontology by exploring the nature of linguistic entities like words and their relationships. It also integrates with Practical Wisdom by providing tools for analyzing and generating meaningful expressions in real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Syntax",
      "description": "The study of how words combine to form sentences and phrases. This subtopic intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the rules and patterns that govern linguistic structures, similar to scientific laws governing natural phenomena. It also relates to Interdisciplinary Synthesis by considering how syntactic rules interact with semantic meanings to convey meaning."
    },
    {
      "name": "Semantics",
      "description": "The study of meaning in language, including word meanings, sentence meanings, and context-dependent interpretations. This subtopic ties into Epistemology by questioning how we understand and validate meaning in language. It also connects to Cognitive Science by exploring how humans interpret and generate meaning from linguistic inputs."
    },
    {
      "name": "Pragmatics",
      "description": "The study of how context influences the interpretation of meaning in communication. This subtopic integrates with Practical Wisdom by focusing on the application of linguistic knowledge in real-world interactions, considering factors like speaker intentions and listener expectations."
