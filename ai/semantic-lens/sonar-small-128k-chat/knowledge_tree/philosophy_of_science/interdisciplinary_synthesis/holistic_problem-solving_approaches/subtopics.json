      "name": "Interdisciplinary Integration",
      "description": "This subtopic involves combining insights from multiple domains to address complex problems. It leverages the interconnectedness of knowledge highlighted by Interdisciplinary Synthesis (Level 1) to create a comprehensive understanding. By integrating principles from Epistemology, Ontology, Cognitive Science, and Philosophy of Science, holistic problem-solving approaches can provide a more robust and accurate solution to real-world challenges."
    },
    {
      "name": "Contextual Understanding",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the importance of considering the broader context in which problems arise. It aligns with the Practical Wisdom domain by recognizing that real-world applications require an understanding of the specific circumstances and ethical implications. By examining the structure and content of knowledge through Ontology and the nature of scientific inquiry through Philosophy of Science, contextual understanding enhances the effectiveness of problem-solving efforts."
    },
    {
      "name": "Dynamic Adaptation",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the ability to adapt and evolve problem-solving strategies as new information becomes available. It reflects the dynamic nature of knowledge acquisition and validation discussed in Epistemology. By integrating insights from Cognitive Science about how humans process information and learn, dynamic adaptation ensures that holistic problem-solving approaches remain flexible and responsive to changing circumstances."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "This subtopic underscores the importance of ethical reasoning in holistic problem-solving. It aligns with Practical Wisdom by recognizing that decisions have real-world consequences. By examining the ethical implications through the lens of Ontology and the methodological considerations of Philosophy of Science, ethical considerations ensure that solutions are not only effective but also morally sound."
