    {
      "name": "Integration of Theoretical Frameworks",
      "description": "This subtopic involves combining theoretical frameworks from multiple domains to form a cohesive understanding. It relates to Level 1 by breaking down the abstract principles of interdisciplinary synthesis into practical applications. For instance, integrating epistemological questions about knowledge validation with ontological inquiries about the nature of reality helps in developing robust cross-disciplinary methodologies."
    },
    {
      "name": "Collaborative Research Practices",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the practical aspects of conducting research across different disciplines. It aligns with Level 2 by mapping abstract principles to concrete fields, such as cognitive science's understanding of human perception and memory, which are crucial for effective collaboration in cross-disciplinary research."
    },
    {
      "name": "Methodological Flexibility",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the need for adaptability in research methods when dealing with diverse disciplines. It connects to Level 1 by highlighting the importance of practical wisdom in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world contexts, ensuring that methodologies remain flexible and responsive to the complexities of interdisciplinary problems."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations",
      "description": "This subtopic addresses the ethical implications of cross-disciplinary research, ensuring that methodologies respect the boundaries and principles of each contributing domain. It relates to Level 0 by grounding all knowledge in a fundamental worldview that values ethical reasoning and responsible application of knowledge."
    },
    {
      "name": "Evaluation Metrics",
      "description": "This subtopic involves developing metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and validity of cross-disciplinary methodologies. It aligns with Level 1 by breaking down the abstract principles of interdisciplinary synthesis into measurable components, ensuring that research outcomes are rigorously assessed across multiple domains."
