      "description": "Methods and Paradigms in Philosophy of Science is a critical component of Level 1 in our knowledge structure. It breaks down the foundational framework of Epistemology (Level 0) by examining how scientific inquiry is conducted and validated. This domain integrates with Ontology by exploring the nature of reality as it pertains to scientific observation and measurement. It also intersects with Cognitive Science by understanding how human perception and cognition influence scientific methods."
