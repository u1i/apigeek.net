      "name": "Integration of Theoretical Frameworks",
      "description": "This subtopic involves combining theoretical frameworks from multiple disciplines to form a comprehensive understanding. It relates to Level 1 by breaking down the abstract principle of interdisciplinary synthesis into practical applications. At Level 2, it maps this principle to specific areas like philosophy of science, cognitive science, and practical wisdom, demonstrating how different domains contribute to a unified understanding."
    },
    {
      "name": "Collaborative Research Methods",
      "description": "This subtopic focuses on the methodologies used in interdisciplinary research. It connects to Level 1 by illustrating how practical wisdom integrates theoretical understanding with real-world contexts. At Level 2, it maps these methods to specific domains like philosophy of science and cognitive science, showing how collaborative approaches enhance the validity and applicability of knowledge."

    {
      "name": "Cross-Disciplinary Problem-Solving",
      "description": "This subtopic emphasizes the application of interdisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems. It relates to Level 1 by demonstrating how practical wisdom applies theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios. At Level 2, it maps this approach to specific domains like philosophy of science and cognitive science, highlighting how diverse perspectives lead to innovative solutions."

    {
      "name": "Ontological and Epistemological Reflections",
      "description": "This subtopic involves reflecting on the ontological and epistemological implications of interdisciplinary approaches. It connects to Level 1 by examining the foundational questions about knowledge acquisition and validation. At Level 2, it maps these reflections to specific domains like philosophy of science and ontology, demonstrating how understanding existence and reality informs interdisciplinary synthesis."
