    "framework_context": {
      "epistemology": "Paradigms in Scientific Inquiry are deeply rooted in epistemology as they address the nature and sources of scientific knowledge. This domain helps validate and understand how scientific knowledge is acquired.",
      "ontology": "Ontological considerations are essential in understanding the existence and reality of scientific paradigms. It explores how these paradigms reflect or shape our understanding of the world.",
      "cognitive science": "Cognitive science provides insights into how scientists process and generate knowledge within these paradigms, influencing perception, attention, and problem-solving.",
      "philosophy of science": "This topic is a central concern within philosophy of science, examining the foundations, methods, and implications of scientific inquiry through different paradigms.",
      "practical wisdom": "Practical wisdom is applied in the context of scientific inquiry by integrating theoretical understanding with practical experience, guiding decision-making and problem-solving within established paradigms.",
      "interdisciplinary synthesis": "Interdisciplinary synthesis is exemplified by integrating knowledge from multiple domains (e.g., philosophy, cognitive science) to form a comprehensive understanding of scientific paradigms."
