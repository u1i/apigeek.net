      "name": "Scientific Inquiry Methods",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the various methods used in scientific inquiry, such as experimentation, observation, and data analysis. It delves into how these methods are employed to validate hypotheses and generate new knowledge, aligning with the Epistemology domain's focus on knowledge acquisition and validation. It also intersects with Cognitive Science by examining how human perception and attention influence these methods."

    {
      "name": "Ethical Considerations in Scientific Research",
      "description": "This subtopic addresses the ethical implications of scientific research, including issues related to data integrity, informed consent, and the responsible use of scientific findings. It integrates with Practical Wisdom by focusing on the ethical reasoning required in applying scientific knowledge. It also intersects with Epistemology by considering the moral limits of knowledge acquisition."
    },
    {
      "name": "Historical Development of Scientific Methods",
      "description": "This subtopic explores the historical evolution of scientific methods and paradigms, tracing how they have developed over time. It reflects the Ontology domain's study of existence and reality by examining how our understanding of the world has changed through scientific inquiry. It also engages with Philosophy of Science by analyzing the historical context that shaped current scientific practices."
