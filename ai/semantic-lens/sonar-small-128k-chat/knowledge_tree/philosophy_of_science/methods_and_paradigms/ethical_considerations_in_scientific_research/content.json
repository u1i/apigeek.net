      "description": "Ethical Considerations in Scientific Research is a specific domain that exemplifies the intersection of Epistemology, Ontology, and Practical Wisdom. It falls under the broader category of Philosophy of Science, which examines the foundations and methods of scientific inquiry. This topic integrates theoretical understanding from Epistemology (how we acquire and validate knowledge) and Ontology (the nature of existence and reality) with practical applications from Practical Wisdom (the application of knowledge in real-world contexts)."

      {
        "name": "Informed Consent",
        "explanation": "The principle that participants in scientific research must provide voluntary consent after being fully informed about the nature, risks, and benefits of the research."
      },
      {
        "name": "Beneficence",
        "explanation": "The duty to promote the well-being and benefit of research participants, ensuring that the research does not harm them and that any potential risks are minimized."

      {
        "name": "Non-Maleficence",
        "explanation": "The principle of doing no harm; researchers must avoid causing physical or psychological harm to participants."

      {
        "name": "Respect for Autonomy",

      {
        "description": "Ethical considerations in scientific research have broader implications for knowledge organization by ensuring that all domains of knowledge are developed with integrity and respect for human subjects. This integration promotes holistic approaches to complex problems by considering both theoretical foundations and practical applications."
