      "epistemology": "Scientific Inquiry Methods are deeply rooted in epistemology, as they address how we acquire and validate knowledge through systematic observation, experimentation, and evidence-based reasoning.",
      "ontology": "These methods help us understand the nature of reality by examining the attributes and relations of phenomena within the natural world.",
      "cognitive science": "The cognitive processes involved in scientific inquiry\u2014such as perception, attention, memory, and problem-solving\u2014are crucial for understanding how humans generate and process scientific knowledge.",
      "philosophy of science": "Scientific Inquiry Methods are central to the philosophy of science, as they provide the foundational methods and paradigms for scientific inquiry, influencing our understanding of scientific knowledge and its relationship to other forms of knowledge."
