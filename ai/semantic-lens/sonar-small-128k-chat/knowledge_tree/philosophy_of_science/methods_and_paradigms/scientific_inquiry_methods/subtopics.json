      "name": "Empirical Observation",
      "description": "The systematic collection of data through observation, which is foundational to scientific inquiry. This method aligns with Epistemology by addressing how we acquire knowledge and with Cognitive Science by understanding how humans process sensory information. It also relates to Ontology by exploring the nature of reality through empirical evidence."
    },
    {
      "name": "Hypothesis Formation",
      "description": "The process of generating hypotheses based on observed data, which is a critical step in scientific inquiry. This method integrates with Epistemology by examining the sources of knowledge and with Philosophy of Science by understanding the foundational principles of scientific inquiry. It also involves practical wisdom in decision-making about which hypotheses to test."
    },
    {
      "name": "Experimental Design",
      "description": "The systematic planning and execution of experiments to test hypotheses, ensuring that results are reliable and valid. This method aligns with Cognitive Science by understanding how humans perceive and interpret data, and with Philosophy of Science by examining the methods used in scientific inquiry. It also involves practical wisdom in designing experiments that minimize bias and maximize reliability."
    },
    {
      "name": "Data Analysis",
      "description": "The process of interpreting and analyzing data collected from experiments or observations, which is essential for drawing conclusions. This method integrates with Cognitive Science by understanding how humans process information and with Philosophy of Science by examining the implications of data analysis on scientific knowledge. It also involves practical wisdom in making decisions based on data-driven insights."
    },
    {
      "name": "Peer Review",
      "description": "The process of having scientific findings reviewed by peers to ensure validity and reliability, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of scientific knowledge. This method aligns with Epistemology by validating knowledge claims and with Philosophy of Science by examining the foundations of scientific inquiry. It also involves practical wisdom in ethical reasoning about the dissemination of knowledge."
