      "name": "Regulatory Mechanisms and Enforcement",
      "description": "This subtopic delves into the mechanisms and processes by which regulatory frameworks are enforced. It includes discussions on institutional structures, legal frameworks, and the role of oversight bodies. This subtopic is closely tied to cognitive science, as it involves understanding how humans process information and make decisions within complex regulatory systems. It also falls under the philosophy of science by examining how scientific evidence informs regulatory policies."
