## Key Concepts

### Definition

Accidental Attributes are properties or characteristics that do not define the essential nature of a thing but rather describe its contingent or variable aspects.

### Examples

Examples include color, shape, size, and location. These attributes can change over time or vary depending on context.

### Distinction from Essential Attributes

Accidental Attributes are distinguished from Essential Attributes, which are properties that define the very essence of a thing.
