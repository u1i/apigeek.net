## Key Concepts

### Substance

Substance refers to the underlying entities or objects that exist independently. Relations describe how these substances interact or are related to one another.

### Attribute

Attributes are properties or characteristics that describe substances. Relations can be seen as attributes that define how substances interact or are connected.

### Identity

Identity refers to the unique characteristics that distinguish one substance from another. Relations help establish these identities by defining how substances are distinct or similar.
