## Key Concepts

### Substance

The underlying entity or thing that possesses attributes. Substances are the base units of existence and reality.

### Attribute

Properties or characteristics that describe substances. Attributes can be intrinsic (inherent) or extrinsic (dependent on context).

### Relation

The way attributes interact with each other and with substances. Relations define how different attributes are connected and how they influence one another.
