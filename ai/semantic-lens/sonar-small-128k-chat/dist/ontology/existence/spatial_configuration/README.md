## Key Concepts

### Spatial Relations

Spatial relations describe how objects or entities are positioned in space relative to each other. This includes concepts like proximity, distance, orientation, and spatial order.

### Topological Properties

Topological properties refer to the qualitative aspects of spatial configurations that are preserved under continuous deformations. These include features like connectedness, compactness, and holes.

### Geometric Structures

Geometric structures involve the study of shapes and their properties in space. This includes points, lines, planes, and higher-dimensional spaces.
