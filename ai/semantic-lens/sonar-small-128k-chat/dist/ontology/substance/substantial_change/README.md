In Ontology, substance refers to the underlying reality or being that possesses attributes. Substantial change involves alterations in these substances, which are essential for understanding how reality evolves.

### Attribute

Attributes are properties or characteristics that belong to substances. Substantial change can involve changes in these attributes, such as transformations or modifications that affect the nature of being.

### Relation

Relations describe how substances and attributes interact with each other. Substantial change often involves changes in these relations, such as causality or dependency, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics of reality.
