## Key Concepts

### Substance

A substance is a fundamental entity that exists independently and has inherent properties. It is the primary subject of ontology, providing the foundation for understanding reality.

### Identity

Identity refers to the unique characteristics or properties that define a substance. It is crucial for distinguishing one substance from another and for understanding how substances persist over time.

### Essentialism

Essentialism is the philosophical position that substances have essential properties that define their identity. This concept is central to discussions about substance identity, as it helps determine what makes a substance what it is.
