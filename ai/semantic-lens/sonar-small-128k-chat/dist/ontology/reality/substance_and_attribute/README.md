## Key Concepts

### Substance

Substance refers to the underlying entity or being that possesses attributes. It is the fundamental unit of existence, providing a basis for understanding what exists in reality.

### Attribute

Attributes are properties or characteristics that describe substances. They can be qualitative (e.g., color, shape) or quantitative (e.g., size, weight), and they help define the nature of substances.
