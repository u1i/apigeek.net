[Home](../../../README.md) / [Ontology](../../../ontology/README.md)

## Key Concepts

### Substance

The fundamental entity or thing that exists independently, serving as the basis for understanding reality.

### Attribute

Properties or characteristics that describe and define substances, helping to articulate the nature of reality.

### Relation

The connections and interactions between substances and attributes, which shape our comprehension of reality.

## Topics

- [Existence](existence/README.md): The fundamental question of whether something exists or not. This subtopic delves into the nature of being, which is essential for understanding the structure and content of knowledge. It relates to Ontology, as it explores the nature of existence and reality, and is foundational to Epistemology, as it influences how we acquire and validate knowledge.
- [Perception and Subjectivity](perception_and_subjectivity/README.md): This subtopic explores how reality is perceived by individuals and how subjective experiences shape our understanding of the world. It is closely related to Cognitive Science, as it examines how the mind processes sensory information. It also has implications for Epistemology, as it influences how we validate and understand knowledge.
- [Relation and Interconnectedness](relation_and_interconnectedness/README.md): This subtopic investigates how different entities in reality are related to each other. It is integral to Ontology, as it explores the relationships between substances and attributes. It also has significant implications for Cognitive Science, as it influences how we perceive and understand the interconnectedness of the world.
- [Substance and Attribute](substance_and_attribute/README.md): This subtopic examines the concepts of substance and attribute, which are crucial for understanding the composition of reality. It is deeply rooted in Ontology, as it explores the fundamental building blocks of existence. It also has implications for Epistemology, as it affects how we categorize and understand the world around us.
- [Temporal and Spatial Dimensions](temporal_and_spatial_dimensions/README.md): This subtopic examines the temporal and spatial dimensions of reality, including concepts like time, space, and causality. It is essential for Ontology, as it provides a framework for understanding the dynamic nature of existence. It also has implications for Cognitive Science, as it affects how we perceive and process information about the world.
