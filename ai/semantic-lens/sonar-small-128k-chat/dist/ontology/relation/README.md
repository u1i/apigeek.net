## Key Concepts

### Substance

### Attribute

### Relation

The connection or interaction between substances or attributes, forming the core of Ontology's study.

## Topics

- [Functional Relations](functional_relations/README.md): Functional relations describe the roles or functions that entities play within a system or context. This includes concepts like causation, dependency, and interaction. Functional relations are pivotal in Cognitive Science as they help explain how the mind processes information and generates knowledge. They also have significant implications for Practical Wisdom by informing decision-making processes.
- [Spatial Relations](spatial_relations/README.md): Spatial relations pertain to the spatial arrangement and organization of entities. These relations are fundamental in Cognitive Science as they underlie perception and spatial reasoning. Spatial relations also have practical implications for navigation, architecture, and urban planning, making them relevant to Practical Wisdom.
- [Substantive Relations](substantive_relations/README.md): Substantive relations refer to the inherent connections between entities, such as causality, similarity, and identity. These relations are fundamental to understanding the structure of reality and are essential for constructing ontological frameworks. They are deeply rooted in the study of existence and reality (Ontology) and play a crucial role in validating knowledge claims (Epistemology).
- [Temporal Relations](temporal_relations/README.md): Temporal relations concern the ordering of events or states in time. Understanding temporal relations is essential for constructing coherent narratives and predicting future outcomes. This aspect of relations intersects with Philosophy of Science by influencing the methodology of scientific inquiry and the interpretation of data over time.
