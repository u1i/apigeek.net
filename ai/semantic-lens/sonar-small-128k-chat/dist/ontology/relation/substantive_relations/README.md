## Key Concepts

### Substance

In Ontology, substance refers to the fundamental entities or objects that exist independently. Substantive Relations describe how these substances interact and relate to each other.

### Attribute

Attributes are properties or characteristics that substances possess. Substantive Relations also involve how attributes are distributed among substances and how they influence the nature of these relations.

### Relation

A relation is a connection or bond between substances or attributes. Substantive Relations specifically focus on the intrinsic or essential connections between substances, which are fundamental for understanding their existence and behavior.
