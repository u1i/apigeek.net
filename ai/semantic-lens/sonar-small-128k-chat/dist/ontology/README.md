## Topics

- [Attribute](attribute/README.md): Attributes are properties or characteristics that substances possess. This subtopic delves into the nature of attributes and their relationships with substances, aligning with Ontology's focus on existence and reality. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining how scientific inquiry defines and measures attributes.
- [Existence](existence/README.md): Existence is a fundamental concept in ontology, addressing questions about what exists and how it exists. This subtopic is foundational to Epistemology as it sets the stage for understanding what can be known. It also intersects with Cognitive Science by influencing how we perceive and understand the world around us.
- [Reality](reality/README.md): Reality encompasses all that exists, including both physical and abstract entities. This subtopic is central to ontology, providing a comprehensive view of existence. It aligns with Interdisciplinary Synthesis by highlighting the interconnectedness of all knowledge domains, as understanding reality requires integrating insights from various fields.
- [Relation](relation/README.md): Relations describe how substances and attributes interact or stand in relation to one another. This subtopic is crucial for understanding the structure and content of knowledge, as it provides a framework for organizing and connecting different pieces of information. It integrates with Practical Wisdom by informing how we reason about complex systems and relationships in real-world contexts.
- [Substance](substance/README.md): Ontology explores the nature of being, including concepts like substance, which refers to the fundamental entities or objects that exist independently. This subtopic relates to Epistemology by understanding how we acquire knowledge about these substances, and it integrates with Cognitive Science by considering how our perception and understanding of substances shape our knowledge.
