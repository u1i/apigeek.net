## Key Concepts

### Information Saturation

The point at which the human mind can no longer effectively process additional information without a significant decrease in comprehension or accuracy.

### Cognitive Load

The amount of mental effort required to process and retain information, which can be influenced by factors such as complexity, novelty, and relevance.

### Complexity Theory

A branch of study that examines how complex systems behave and evolve over time, often involving non-linear dynamics and emergent properties.
