## Key Concepts

### Neural Plasticity

The brain's ability to reorganize itself in response to new experiences, which is crucial for learning and memory formation.

### Hebbian Learning

A type of synaptic plasticity where neurons that fire together wire together, illustrating how neural connections are strengthened through experience.

### Consolidation

The process by which short-term memories are converted into long-term ones, involving changes in neural connections and strength.
