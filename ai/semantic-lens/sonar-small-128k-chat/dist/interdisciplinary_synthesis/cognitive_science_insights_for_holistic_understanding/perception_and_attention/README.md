## Key Concepts

### Sensory Perception

The process by which the brain interprets sensory information from the environment, including visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory inputs.

### Attentional Control

The ability to selectively concentrate on one aspect of the environment while ignoring others, crucial for focusing on relevant stimuli and filtering out irrelevant information.

### Neural Mechanisms

The underlying neural structures and processes that enable perception and attention, including brain regions like the primary visual cortex and attentional networks.
