## Key Concepts

### Encoding

The process by which information is initially stored in memory, often involving sensory input and initial processing.

### Retrieval

The process of accessing stored information from memory, which can be influenced by factors such as context and prior experiences.

### Consolidation

The process by which short-term memories are converted into long-term memories, often requiring repetition and practice.
