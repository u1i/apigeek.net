## Key Concepts

### Cognitive Biases

Cognitive biases refer to systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Understanding these biases is crucial for effective problem-solving and decision-making.

### Heuristics

Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that help in making decisions or solving problems more efficiently. They often involve trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

### Decision Theories

Decision theories provide frameworks for evaluating and making decisions under uncertainty. They include concepts like expected utility theory and game theory.
