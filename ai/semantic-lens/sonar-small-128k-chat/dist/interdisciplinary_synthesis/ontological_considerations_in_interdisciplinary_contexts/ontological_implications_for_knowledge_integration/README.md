## Key Concepts

### Existential Categories

The fundamental categories through which we understand and organize the world, such as substance, attribute, and relation. These categories are essential for structuring knowledge and ensuring coherence across different domains.

### Reality Constructs

The ways in which we construct our understanding of reality, including the role of perception, language, and cognitive processes. These constructs shape how we integrate knowledge from various fields.

### Ontological Commitments

The assumptions and beliefs about the nature of existence that underlie our understanding of knowledge. These commitments influence how we validate and apply knowledge in practical contexts.
