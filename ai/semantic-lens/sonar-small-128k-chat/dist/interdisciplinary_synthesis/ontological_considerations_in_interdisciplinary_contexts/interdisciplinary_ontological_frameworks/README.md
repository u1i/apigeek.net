## Key Concepts

### Integrated Ontological Models

These models combine disparate ontological frameworks to create a unified understanding of existence. They address issues like substance, attribute, and relation across multiple disciplines.

### Disciplinary Ontologies

Each discipline has its own ontology; IOFs bring these together to highlight commonalities and differences, fostering a deeper understanding of reality.

### Contextual Relativity

IOFs recognize that ontological truths are context-dependent. This principle emphasizes the importance of considering the specific context in which knowledge is applied.
