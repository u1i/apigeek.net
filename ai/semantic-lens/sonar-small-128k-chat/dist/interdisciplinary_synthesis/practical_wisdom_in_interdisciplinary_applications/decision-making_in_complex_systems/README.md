## Key Concepts

### Complexity

The inherent complexity of systems that involve multiple variables, uncertainties, and interdependencies, requiring adaptive and dynamic decision-making strategies.

### Uncertainty

The presence of incomplete or uncertain information that necessitates probabilistic reasoning and risk assessment in decision-making processes.

### Interconnectedness

The interconnected nature of systems where decisions can have cascading effects across various components, necessitating holistic consideration.

### Adaptability

The ability to adjust decision-making strategies based on changing conditions and new information, reflecting the dynamic nature of complex systems.
