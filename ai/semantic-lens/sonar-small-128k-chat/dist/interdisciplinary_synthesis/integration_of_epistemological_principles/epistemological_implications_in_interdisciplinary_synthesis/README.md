## Key Concepts

### Integration of Epistemological Principles

The process of incorporating fundamental questions about knowledge acquisition, validation, and understanding into interdisciplinary research. This involves recognizing the sources and limits of knowledge within diverse fields.

### Holistic Understanding

The comprehensive approach to complex problems that considers multiple domains of knowledge. This requires synthesizing insights from various disciplines to form a unified understanding.

### Contextual Validation

The practice of validating knowledge claims within specific contexts. This involves ensuring that epistemological principles are applied in a manner that is relevant and effective for the particular interdisciplinary problem being addressed.
