## Key Concepts

### Cognitive Biases

Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts that can lead to systematic errors in thinking and decision-making. Understanding these biases is crucial for effective problem-solving, as they can distort our perception of reality and lead to suboptimal solutions.

### Heuristics

Heuristics are mental strategies that help us make decisions and solve problems more efficiently. They often involve simplifying complex problems into more manageable parts, but they can also lead to errors if not used judiciously.

### Feedback Loops

Feedback loops are essential for iterative problem-solving. They allow us to adjust our approach based on the outcomes of our actions, refining our solutions over time.
