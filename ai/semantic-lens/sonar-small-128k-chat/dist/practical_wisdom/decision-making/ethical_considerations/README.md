## Key Concepts

### Moral Principles

Core ethical guidelines that serve as the foundation for making decisions. These principles help in evaluating actions and their consequences.

### Consequentialism

An ethical theory that suggests the morality of an action should be determined by its consequences. This concept is crucial in practical wisdom as it guides decision-making based on potential outcomes.

### Deontology

An ethical theory that emphasizes the importance of duties and rules rather than consequences. Deontology provides a framework for understanding obligations and responsibilities in ethical decision-making.
