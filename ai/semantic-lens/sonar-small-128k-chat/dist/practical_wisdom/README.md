[Home](../README.md)

## Key Concepts

### Decision-Making

The process of making informed choices based on available information and ethical considerations. It involves weighing options, assessing risks, and selecting the most appropriate course of action.

### Problem-Solving

The systematic approach to identifying and resolving complex issues. It involves critical thinking, creativity, and often requires integrating knowledge from multiple domains.

### Ethical Reasoning

The process of evaluating actions or decisions based on moral principles and values. It ensures that practical wisdom is guided by ethical standards.

## Topics

- [Decision-Making](decision-making/README.md): Decision-making is a core component of practical wisdom, integrating theoretical understanding with real-world experience. It involves evaluating information, considering ethical implications, and choosing actions that align with both knowledge and values. This subtopic relates to Level 1 by manifesting the application of knowledge in real-world contexts, and it connects to Level 2 by being a specific domain within practical wisdom, such as decision theory or ethical decision-making.
- [Ethical Reasoning](ethical_reasoning/README.md): Ethical reasoning is crucial for practical wisdom as it involves understanding the ethical implications of actions and decisions. This subtopic relates to Level 1 by applying theoretical knowledge to real-world ethical dilemmas and connects to Level 2 by being a specific domain within practical wisdom, such as moral philosophy or business ethics.
- [Interdisciplinary Integration](interdisciplinary_integration/README.md): Interdisciplinary integration is essential for practical wisdom as it involves synthesizing knowledge from multiple domains (Interdisciplinary Synthesis) to address complex problems effectively. This subtopic relates to Level 1 by demonstrating how knowledge is applied in holistic approaches and connects to Level 2 by being a specific domain within practical wisdom, such as systems thinking or transdisciplinary research.
- [Problem-Solving](problem-solving/README.md): Problem-solving is another essential aspect of practical wisdom, requiring the integration of cognitive processes like perception, attention, and memory (Cognitive Science) with the ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations. This subtopic aligns with Level 1 by demonstrating how knowledge is applied in real-world contexts and connects to Level 2 by being a specific domain within practical wisdom, such as decision theory or conflict resolution.
- [Skill Development](skill_development/README.md): Skill development is a key component of practical wisdom, focusing on the acquisition and refinement of skills necessary for effective decision-making and problem-solving. This subtopic aligns with Level 1 by manifesting the application of knowledge in real-world contexts and connects to Level 2 by being a specific domain within practical wisdom, such as vocational training or professional development.
