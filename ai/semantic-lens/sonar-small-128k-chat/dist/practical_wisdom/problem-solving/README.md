[Home](../../../README.md) / [Practical Wisdom](../../../practical_wisdom/README.md)

## Key Concepts

### Critical Thinking

The ability to analyze information objectively and make informed decisions.

### Creativity

The capacity to generate novel solutions by combining existing knowledge in new ways.

### Feedback Loop

A continuous cycle of action, observation, and adjustment to refine problem-solving strategies.

## Topics

- [Cognitive Strategies](cognitive_strategies/README.md): Cognitive strategies involve the mental processes and techniques used to approach and resolve problems. This includes methods like breaking down complex problems into simpler components, using heuristics, and employing active recall. These strategies are rooted in cognitive science, which studies how the mind processes information, and are essential for practical wisdom as they aid in decision-making and problem-solving in real-world contexts.
- [Critical Thinking](critical_thinking/README.md): Critical thinking is the systematic evaluation and analysis of information to form a judgment. It involves identifying biases, evaluating evidence, and considering multiple perspectives. Critical thinking is fundamental to both epistemology and philosophy of science as it helps validate knowledge claims and assess the reliability of information. In practical wisdom, critical thinking is crucial for making informed decisions and solving complex problems.
- [Ethical Considerations](ethical_considerations/README.md): Ethical considerations in problem-solving involve evaluating the moral implications of potential solutions. This includes considering the impact on stakeholders, adhering to ethical principles, and ensuring that solutions are just and fair. Ethical reasoning is a key aspect of practical wisdom as it integrates theoretical understanding with real-world applications, ensuring that knowledge is applied responsibly.
- [Interdisciplinary Approaches](interdisciplinary_approaches/README.md): Interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving involve integrating knowledge from multiple domains to address complex issues. This might include combining insights from cognitive science, philosophy of science, and practical wisdom to develop comprehensive solutions. Interdisciplinary synthesis is essential at this level as it highlights the interconnectedness of all knowledge and encourages holistic approaches to complex problems.
