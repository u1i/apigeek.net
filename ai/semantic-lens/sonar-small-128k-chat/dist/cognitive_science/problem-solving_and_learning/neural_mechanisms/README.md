## Key Concepts

### Synaptic Plasticity

The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time in response to increases or decreases in their activity. This concept is crucial for understanding how learning and memory are encoded in the brain.

### Neural Pathways

The networks of neurons and their connections that enable the transmission of signals within the brain. These pathways are essential for various cognitive functions like perception and problem-solving.

### Neurotransmitters

Chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses. They play a vital role in regulating various cognitive processes and are often targeted in treatments for neurological disorders.
