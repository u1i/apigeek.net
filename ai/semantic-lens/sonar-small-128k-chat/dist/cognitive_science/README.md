# Cognitive Science

[Home](../README.md)

## Key Concepts

### Perception

The process by which the brain interprets sensory information from the environment.

### Attention

The ability to selectively concentrate on one aspect of the environment while ignoring others.

### Memory

The cognitive process that allows us to retain information over time.

### Language

The system of communication that allows humans to convey meaning through symbols and sounds.

### Problem-Solving

The cognitive process that involves identifying problems and developing strategies to solve them.

### Learning

The process by which knowledge and skills are acquired through experience or instruction.

## Topics

- [Attention and Memory](attention_and_memory/README.md): The examination of how humans focus attention and retain information. This subtopic integrates with Level 0 by considering the foundational principles of knowledge acquisition and retention. It aligns with Level 1 by dissecting cognitive science into its core components, and with Level 2 by exploring concrete fields like working memory and long-term memory.
- [Language and Communication](language_and_communication/README.md): The investigation into how humans process and generate language. This subtopic connects with Level 0 by understanding the nature of knowledge representation and expression. It fits within Level 1 by categorizing cognitive science into its primary aspects, and with Level 2 by mapping to specific domains such as linguistics and psycholinguistics.
- [Neural Mechanisms](neural_mechanisms/README.md): The exploration of the neural processes underlying cognitive functions. This subtopic integrates with Level 0 by understanding the biological basis of knowledge processing. It fits within Level 1 by categorizing cognitive science into its primary aspects, and with Level 2 by mapping to specific domains such as neuroscience and neurocognition.
- [Perception](perception/README.md): The study of how humans perceive and interpret sensory information. This subtopic relates to Level 0 by understanding how cognitive processes interact with the fundamental worldview, and to Level 1 by breaking down cognitive science into its primary aspects. It maps to Level 2 by examining specific domains such as visual perception, auditory perception, and tactile perception.
- [Problem-Solving and Learning](problem-solving_and_learning/README.md): The study of how humans solve problems and learn new information. This subtopic intersects with Level 0 by examining the practical application of knowledge. It aligns with Level 1 by breaking down cognitive science into its core components, and with Level 2 by exploring concrete fields like cognitive development and educational psychology.
