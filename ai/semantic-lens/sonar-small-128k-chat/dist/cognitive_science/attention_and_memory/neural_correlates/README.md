## Key Concepts

### Neural Pathways

The network of interconnected neurons that facilitate communication between different brain regions, crucial for understanding how information is processed and transmitted.

### Synaptic Plasticity

The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, enabling learning and memory formation.

### Brain Regions

Specific areas of the brain responsible for different cognitive functions, such as attention and memory.
