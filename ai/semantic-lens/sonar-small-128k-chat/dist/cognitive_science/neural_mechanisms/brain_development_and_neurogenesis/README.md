## Key Concepts

### Neural Plasticity

The brain's ability to reorganize itself in response to new experiences or learning is crucial for understanding how knowledge is processed and stored.

### Synaptic Pruning

The process by which the brain eliminates unnecessary neural connections, refining its structure and function.

### Neurotransmitters

Chemical messengers that facilitate communication between neurons, essential for various cognitive functions.
