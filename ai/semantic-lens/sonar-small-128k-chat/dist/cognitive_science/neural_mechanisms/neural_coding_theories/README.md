## Key Concepts

### Spiking Activity

Spiking activity refers to the electrical impulses generated by neurons. This concept is central to understanding how neural coding theories decode and encode information within the brain.

### Population Coding

Population coding involves the collective activity of multiple neurons working together to represent information. This concept highlights how distributed processing occurs in the brain.

### Synaptic Plasticity

Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of neural connections (synapses) to change strength based on experience. This concept is crucial for understanding how learning and memory are encoded in the brain.
