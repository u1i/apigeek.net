# Neural Mechanisms

[Home](../../../README.md) / [Cognitive Science](../../../cognitive_science/README.md)

## Key Concepts

### Synaptic Plasticity

The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time in response to increases or decreases in their activity, which is crucial for learning and memory.

### Neurotransmitters

Chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses, influencing various cognitive functions such as mood regulation and attention.

### Brain Regions

Distinct areas within the brain responsible for different cognitive processes, such as the prefrontal cortex for decision-making and the hippocampus for memory formation.

## Topics

- [Brain Development and Neurogenesis](brain_development_and_neurogenesis/README.md): The study of how the brain develops and generates new neurons, which is essential for understanding cognitive development and neurological disorders. This subtopic integrates with Ontology by exploring the dynamic nature of existence in the context of brain development. It also aligns with Practical Wisdom by informing strategies for cognitive rehabilitation and neuroplasticity-based interventions.
- [Neural Coding Theories](neural_coding_theories/README.md): Theories that explain how neurons represent and transmit information, which is crucial for understanding how the brain processes sensory data. This subtopic connects to Cognitive Science by elucidating the neural basis of perception and decision-making. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the empirical methods used to develop these theories.
- [Neural Oscillations and Synchronization](neural_oscillations_and_synchronization/README.md): The rhythmic patterns of brain activity that facilitate communication between different brain regions, which is vital for coordinating cognitive functions. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by explaining how neural oscillations support complex cognitive tasks like attention and memory retrieval. It also ties into Interdisciplinary Synthesis by highlighting the interconnectedness of different brain regions during cognitive processes.
- [Neurotransmitter Systems](neurotransmitter_systems/README.md): The chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons, which are fundamental to regulating various physiological and psychological processes. This subtopic connects to Cognitive Science by explaining how neurotransmitters influence mood, motivation, and other cognitive functions. It also intersects with Philosophy of Science by examining the empirical evidence supporting different neurotransmitter theories.
- [Synaptic Plasticity](synaptic_plasticity/README.md): The ability of neural connections to change and adapt based on experience, which is fundamental to learning and memory. This subtopic relates to Cognitive Science by explaining how neural mechanisms underlie cognitive processes like perception, attention, and memory. It also ties into Epistemology by addressing how knowledge is acquired and stored.
