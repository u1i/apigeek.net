## Key Concepts

### Alpha Waves

Alpha waves are a type of neural oscillation typically occurring at frequencies between 8-12 Hz. They are often associated with relaxation and closed eyes.

### Beta Waves

Beta waves are neural oscillations occurring at frequencies between 13-30 Hz. They are commonly linked to active thinking, problem-solving, and motor activity.

### Gamma Waves

Gamma waves are high-frequency neural oscillations occurring at frequencies above 30 Hz. They are thought to play a role in higher cognitive functions such as attention and memory.

### Synchronization

Neural synchronization refers to the coordination of neural activity across different brain regions. This synchronization is crucial for integrating information and facilitating cognitive processes.
