# Synaptic Plasticity

[Home](../../../../README.md) / [Cognitive Science](../../../../cognitive_science/README.md) / [Neural Mechanisms](../../../cognitive_science/neural_mechanisms/README.md)

## Key Concepts

### Hebbian Learning

The idea that 'neurons that fire together, wire together,' illustrating how synaptic connections strengthen through correlated activity.

### Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)

A persistent strengthening of synaptic connections that is thought to be a cellular mechanism for learning and memory.

### Synaptic Depression

A weakening of synaptic connections that can occur due to reduced activity or other factors, contributing to forgetting or learning inhibition.
