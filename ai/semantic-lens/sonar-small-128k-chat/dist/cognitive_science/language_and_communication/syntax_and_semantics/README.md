## Key Concepts

### Symbolic Representation

Symbols in language are used to represent concepts and objects. Understanding how these symbols are structured (syntax) and what they mean (semantics) is essential for effective communication.

### Grammatical Rules

Grammatical rules govern how symbols are combined to form meaningful expressions. These rules are fundamental to both syntax and semantics.

### Semantic Meaning

Semantic meaning refers to the interpretation or understanding of symbols and expressions. It involves understanding context, reference, and truth conditions.
