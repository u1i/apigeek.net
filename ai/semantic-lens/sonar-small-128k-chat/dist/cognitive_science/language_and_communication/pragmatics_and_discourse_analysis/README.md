## Key Concepts

### Contextual Dependency

The meaning of a sentence or utterance depends on the context in which it is used. This concept highlights the dynamic nature of language and its reliance on situational factors.

### Implicature

Implicature refers to the process by which speakers convey meaning beyond what is explicitly stated. This involves understanding inferences and presuppositions in communication.

### Speech Acts

Speech acts theory examines how utterances perform actions rather than simply conveying information. It includes concepts like assertion, command, and promise.
