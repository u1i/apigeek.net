## Key Concepts

### Sensory Modalities

The different senses (vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell) and how they contribute to our overall perception of the world.

### Neural Pathways

The complex neural networks and pathways involved in processing sensory information from the environment to the brain.

### Attention and Focus

The mechanisms by which the brain selectively focuses on certain sensory inputs while filtering out others.

### Memory and Learning

How sensory experiences are stored in memory and how this influences future learning and perception.
