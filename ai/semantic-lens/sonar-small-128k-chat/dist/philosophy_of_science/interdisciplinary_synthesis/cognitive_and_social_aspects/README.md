## Key Concepts

### Cognitive Biases

Cognitive biases refer to systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. These biases highlight the limitations of human cognition and underscore the importance of critical thinking in knowledge acquisition.

### Social Learning Theory

Social learning theory posits that people learn new behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge by observing and imitating others. This concept illustrates how social interactions shape cognitive processes.

### Collective Intelligence

Collective intelligence refers to the shared knowledge and expertise of a group. It demonstrates how social aspects can enhance individual cognitive abilities through collaboration and shared problem-solving.
