### Justification

The process by which knowledge claims are validated or supported. This involves examining the evidence, reasoning, and methods used to establish the truth of a statement.

### Reliability

### Skepticism

A critical approach that questions the certainty of knowledge claims. Skepticism highlights the potential for error and encourages rigorous testing of assumptions.
