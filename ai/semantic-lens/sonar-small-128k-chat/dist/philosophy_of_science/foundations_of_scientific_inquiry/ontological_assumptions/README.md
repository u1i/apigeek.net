### Substance

In the context of ontology, substance refers to the fundamental entities or objects that exist independently. In scientific inquiry, understanding substances is crucial for developing theories and models.

### Attribute

Attributes are properties or characteristics that describe substances. In scientific inquiry, attributes help define the nature of substances and their interactions.

### Relation

Relations describe how substances interact or are related to each other. In scientific inquiry, understanding relations is vital for developing theories about causality and behavior.
