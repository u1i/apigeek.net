## Topics

- [Cognitive Processes](cognitive_processes/README.md): This subtopic focuses on the cognitive processes involved in scientific inquiry. It looks at how scientists perceive, attend to, remember, and process information. By understanding these cognitive processes, this subtopic sheds light on how humans generate and utilize knowledge in scientific contexts, aligning with the cognitive science domain that studies the mind and intelligence.
- [Epistemological Bases](epistemological_bases/README.md): This subtopic explores the epistemological foundations of scientific inquiry, examining how scientific knowledge is acquired and validated. It delves into the nature of scientific evidence, the role of observation and experimentation, and the criteria for accepting scientific theories. This subtopic is crucial for understanding how scientific knowledge fits into the broader framework of epistemology, which is foundational to all other domains.
- [Ethical Considerations](ethical_considerations/README.md): This subtopic addresses ethical considerations in scientific inquiry. It explores issues like objectivity, bias, and responsibility in scientific research. By examining these ethical dimensions, this subtopic integrates practical wisdom by applying theoretical understanding to real-world contexts, ensuring that scientific knowledge is generated and applied ethically.
- [Methodological Principles](methodological_principles/README.md): This subtopic delves into the methodological principles guiding scientific inquiry. It examines the various methods used in scientific research, such as experimentation, observation, and statistical analysis. By exploring these principles, this subtopic provides insights into the nature of scientific inquiry as a distinct field within philosophy of science.
- [Ontological Assumptions](ontological_assumptions/README.md): This subtopic investigates the ontological assumptions underlying scientific inquiry. It examines the nature of reality as understood by science, including concepts like substance, attribute, and relation. By exploring these assumptions, this subtopic helps to clarify how scientific knowledge relates to the broader ontological questions about existence and reality.
