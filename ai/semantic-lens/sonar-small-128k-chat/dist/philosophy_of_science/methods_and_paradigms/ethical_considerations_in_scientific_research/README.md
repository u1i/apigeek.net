### Beneficence

The duty to promote the well-being and benefit of research participants, ensuring that the research does not harm them and that any potential risks are minimized.

### Non-Maleficence

The principle of doing no harm; researchers must avoid causing physical or psychological harm to participants.

### Respect for Autonomy

The respect for participants' rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives, ensuring that they are not coerced into participating in research.
