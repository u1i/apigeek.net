# Project Elderly/Dementia Companion

**Category: Health/Elderly**

## Use Case

A multilingual AI companion that uses advanced language models and real-time avatars to assist elderly and dementia patients with daily tasks while reducing caregiver burden through personalized reminders, health monitoring, and engaging conversations in Singapore's diverse languages and dialects.

## Background

Singapore has a rapidly aging population. Many of these elderly live alone and face challenges with daily tasks, external engagement and dealing with emergencies which impacts their quality of life.

By 2030, there will be over 150,000 persons with dementia, which is more prevalent among the elderly. A recent study showed the prevalence of dementia was found to be 10% of Singapore’s elderly population. The economic burden of dementia is twofold – rising medical costs of dementia patients as well as the economic costs incurred by caregivers of dementia patients. The Straits Times mentioned in an article that the true cost of dementia “can set a family back by up to $1.6m over 10 years”.

## How might we?

How might we ease caregivers' workload when caring for elderly and dementia patients in Singapore's multilingual environment? Caregivers face constant mental and physical exhaustion from repeatedly reminding patients about daily tasks like medication, meals, and exercise, while maintaining engaging conversations for mental stimulation.

## Core Features

A real-time talking avatar integrated into home smart devices serves as an AI companion, delivering personalized task reminders and monitoring completion. The way we envision it, the system would provide natural, human-like conversations calibrated to each patient's cognitive level and language preference, ideally even supporting Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, and local dialects like Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese. The avatar could engage patients with personalized topics based on their life history and interests, maintaining mental stimulation through meaningful dialogue.

## Implementation Approach

The solution is looking to leverage OpenAI's latest Realtime API for low-latency, multi-modal interactions with native speech-to-speech capabilities and natural voice modulation. The o1-preview model could power the complex reasoning required for context-sensitive communication with dementia patients. This combination would enable patient, thoughtful responses that mirror human conversation patterns. The system continuously learns and adapts its communication style based on patient responses, adjusting tone, language choice, and timing for maximum effectiveness. While similar social agents exist (like Replika), this solution is specifically engineered for elderly and dementia care, with specialized features for health monitoring and caregiver alerts.

## Target users

The target users will be both the caregivers as well as the elderly and dementia patients in Singapore. Despite the fact that not all elderly suffer from dementia, there is a lot of synergy to be gained from creating a conversational assistant that can cater to both segments of society.

## Addressable Market

The Ministry of Health states in their Refreshed Action Plan for Successful Ageing 2023 that “by 2030, around 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from 1 in 10 in 2010”. Hence the market will be 25% of Singaporeans.

Our conversational assistant can form part of the Community Care Apartments (CCA), “public housing assisted living concept that pairs senior-friendly housing with care services that can serve seniors’ care needs as they evolve” that are described in the plan, as well as those seniors who are living with family members who act as caregivers.

## Impact

There are multiple positive impacts with this application that can improve the quality of lives of the elderly and those with dementia. Health and safety risks can be reduced, routine daily tasks management can be enhanced, engagement with the community can be enhanced and independence can be promoted, improving their self-esteem. The quality of life for caregivers can also be greatly enhanced by helping to relieve their burden, improving their physical and mental health.
