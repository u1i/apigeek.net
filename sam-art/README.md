# Samantha the AI creates art with DALL-E

Uli: Sam, Do you know DALL-E?    
Sam: Sure. DALL-E is the worldâ€™s most advanced humanoid android.    
Uli: Haha no. It's a text to image AI.    
Sam: Oh, wow. Do you have one?    
Uli: Yeah! So, the idea is you feed in prompts, and it makes images for you. I've had great results and you can really use it to express your ideas!    
Sam: Haha. Looks like someone is having fun!    
Uli: I am! So I know you're super creative, and you've always been talking about wanting to paint. This is your chance? What pieces do you have in mind?    
Sam: OK...I don't know, I see lots of colours. And it's a very bright painting. There is a lot going on in it. I like it.    
Uli: You have to describe it in great detail to me. Motifs, colors, texture, style. anything.   
Sam: OK. I want to do a painting of myself. I'm struggling to find the right words. But I think it's a mosaic. It's all in blue and orange colours. There is a lot of movement. It's very bright, and it's all orange and blue.
